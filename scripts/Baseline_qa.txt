Question : 
What do you know about pleural disease in rheumatoid arthritis?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 Pleural effusion is seen in up to 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The effusion is usually transudate, but occasionally exudate. The effusion is usually small and does not require surgical drainage.
 
gold output :
 About 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have pleural inflammation at autopsy and about 5% have radiological evidence ofpleural inflammation at some time. Pleural involvement is associated with male sex, rheumatoid factor in serum, the presence ofnodules and other systemic manifestations. The effusion is thought to develop as an inflammatory response to the presence ofmultiple subpleural nodules. For reasons that are entirely unclear, the left side is the more common site of unilateral rheumatoidpleural effusions. The pleural fluid glucose level is characteristically low and is said to be due to an 'entrance block' in which glucoseis unable to enter the pleural space, unlike in empyema and malignant effusions where the low pleural fluid glucose concentration isattributed to the increased use of glucose by cells. Cytological appearances of slender and elongated macrophages, round giantmultinucleated macrophages, presence of very few mesothelial cells and necrotic background material are thought to bepathognomonic of rheumatoid pleuritis.

How can CT assess bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 CT can assess bronchiectasis by:·      Obtaining a 3-dimensional image of the chest.·      Using segmentation to determine the location and extent of bronchiectasis.·      Using contrast-enhanced CT to show bronchiectasis.·      Using computerized tomography (CT) scanning to show bronchiectasis.
 
gold output :
 High-resolution CT performed at the end of expiration suggests that small airways disease may be an early feature ofbronchiectasis, which leads to more progressive injury and bronchiolar distortion. Larger studies with long-term follow-up arerequired to confirm this. Conventional CT has a sensitivity of 60-80% for detecting bronchiectasis, whereas high-resolution CT has asensitivity of more than 90%, using bronchography as the 'gold standard'.

 ·       Intravenous heparin.·       If the patient is young, manage with oral anticoagulants.·       If the patient is older, manage with oral anticoagulants and monitor blood pressure.·       If the patient is hypotensive, monitor blood pressure and treat hypotension with oral anticoagulants.·       If the patient is hypovolaemic, manage with oral anticoagulants and monitor blood pressure.
 
gold output :
 ·       Small pneumothoraces (less than 20% in size) spontaneously resolve withinweeks.·       Larger ones (irrespective of size) with normal lungs are managed by simple aspir-ation rather than an intercostal tube as theinitial drainage procedure. Aspiration is less painful than intercostal drainage, leads to a shorter admission and reduces theneed for pleurectomy with no increase in recurrence rate at 1 year.·       When there is rapid re-expansion following simple aspiration, an intercostal tube with underwater seal drainage is used. Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with several chest portsallows clear visualization of the pleural cavity for resection of bullae and pleurodesis.

How would you treat acute respiratory failure?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 · Oxygen. In patients with COAD, oxygen should be given as required, but in patients without COAD oxygen should be given as required for each minute of hypoxaemia. · High-flow oxygen. In patients with COAD, high-flow oxygen should be given for as long as is required to maintain oxygen saturation (usually 2-3 minutes). · Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In patients with COAD, CPAP should be started as soon as oxygen saturation has fallen to 60% or less and maintained at that level or a higher level for as long as is required to maintain oxygen saturation (usually 1-2 hours). · Hypercapnia. In patients with COAD, hypercapnia should be treated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and/or nasal cannulae. · Ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In patients with COAD, ventilation should be increased until oxygen saturation is maintained at 60% or less and then reduced. · High-dose steroids. In patients with COAD, high-dose steroids should be started as soon as oxygen saturation is maintained at 60% or less and maintained at that level or a higher level for as long as is required to maintain oxygen saturation.

Examination · Patient is short of breath at rest and is centrally cyanosed. · Tar staining of the fingers. · JVP is raised: both 'a' and 'v' waves are seen, 'v' waves being prominent if there is associated tricuspid regurgitation. · On examination of the chest there is bilateral wheeze and other signs of chronic bronchitis (see pp 261-6). Proceed as follows: · Examine the cardiovascular system for signs of pulmonary hypertension: -Left parasternal heave (often absent when the chest is barrel shaped). -Right ventricular gallop rhythm. -Loud P2 and a loud ejection click. Pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation. -Early diastolic Graham Steell murmur in the pulmonary area. · Look for signs of: - Hepatomegaly. - Pedal oedema. DIAGNOSIS This patient has chronic cot pulmonale (lesion) due to long-standing COAD (aetiology) and is in congestive cardiac failure (functional status).  
Question : 
What do you understand by the term 'cor pulmonale'?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 The term 'cor pulmonale' refers to a group of conditions in which there is marked pulmonary vascular obstruction, with consequent hypoxia and hypoperfusion of the lung parenchyma. The obstruction is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
 
gold output :
 Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement due to the increase in afterload that occurs in diseases of the lung, chest wall orpulmonary circulation.

 Context : 
 INSTRUCTION Examine this patient's chest. SALIENT FEATURES History · Productive cough. · Increasing dyspnoea. · Weight loss. * History of smoking. · History of alpha-antitrypsin deficiency. Examination · Begin with examination of the sputum pot. · Observe the patient from the end of the bed - for obvious breathlessness, pursed lip breathing and symmetrical chest movements - and count respiratory rate. · Look for nail changes such as tar staining. · Feel the palms for warmth and the pulse for rapid bounding pulse (signs of carbon dioxide retention). · Look at the lips and tongue for central cyanosis. Neck · Comment on the active contractions of the accessory muscles of respiration such as sternocleidomastoids, scaleni and trapezii. · Palpate for tracheal deviation and measure the distance between the cricoid cartilage and suprasternal notch (less than three fingers' breadth in emphysema). · Comment on the raised JVP. Chest Comment on the barrel-shaped chest. Palpate for: · Apex beat. · Chest expansion. · Vocal fremitus. Percussion: Look for hyper-resonance and obliteration of cardiac and liver dullness. Auscultate for: · Breath sounds (diminished breath sounds). · Vocal resonance. · Forced expiratory time: normal individuals can empty their chest from full inspiration in 4 seconds or less. The end-point of FET is detected by auscultating over the trachea in the suprasternal notch. Prolongation of the FET to more than 6 seconds indicates airflow obstruction. · Loud pulmonary second heart sound. Abdomen Palpable liver due to hepatic displacement comment on upper border of liver by percussion). DIAGNOSIS This patient has features of chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD) (lesion) due to cigarette smoking (aetiology) and is very cyanosed at rest (functional status).  
Question : 
What are the general indications for lung transplantation?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 · Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COAD).· Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).· Lymphoma.· Non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC).· Other cancers of the lung including non-small cell tumours (NSC).
 
gold output :
 The general indication is end-stage lung disease without alternative forms of therapy. Patients should be below 60 years of age and should have a life expectancy of less than 12 or 18 months; they should not have an underlying cancer or other serious systemic illness. The most common lung diseases are pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema (particularly alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency), bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary hypertension.
