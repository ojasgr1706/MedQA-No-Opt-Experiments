Question : 
What do you know about pleural disease in rheumatoid arthritis?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 Pleural effusion is seen in up to 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The effusion is usually transudate, but occasionally exudate. The effusion is usually small and does not require surgical drainage.
 
gold output :
 About 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have pleural inflammation at autopsy and about 5% have radiological evidence ofpleural inflammation at some time. Pleural involvement is associated with male sex, rheumatoid factor in serum, the presence ofnodules and other systemic manifestations. The effusion is thought to develop as an inflammatory response to the presence ofmultiple subpleural nodules. For reasons that are entirely unclear, the left side is the more common site of unilateral rheumatoidpleural effusions. The pleural fluid glucose level is characteristically low and is said to be due to an 'entrance block' in which glucoseis unable to enter the pleural space, unlike in empyema and malignant effusions where the low pleural fluid glucose concentration isattributed to the increased use of glucose by cells. Cytological appearances of slender and elongated macrophages, round giantmultinucleated macrophages, presence of very few mesothelial cells and necrotic background material are thought to bepathognomonic of rheumatoid pleuritis.

Question : 
How can CT assess bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 CT can assess bronchiectasis by:·      Obtaining a 3-dimensional image of the chest.·      Using segmentation to determine the location and extent of bronchiectasis.·      Using contrast-enhanced CT to show bronchiectasis.·      Using computerized tomography (CT) scanning to show bronchiectasis.
 
gold output :
 High-resolution CT performed at the end of expiration suggests that small airways disease may be an early feature ofbronchiectasis, which leads to more progressive injury and bronchiolar distortion. Larger studies with long-term follow-up arerequired to confirm this. Conventional CT has a sensitivity of 60-80% for detecting bronchiectasis, whereas high-resolution CT has asensitivity of more than 90%, using bronchography as the 'gold standard'.

 There are three main mechanisms:·       An abnormality of the pleura itself, such as a neoplasm or inflammatory process, usually associated with increasedpermeability.·       Disruption of the integrity of a fluid-containing structure within the pleural cavity, such as the thoracic duct, oesophagus, majorblood vessels or tracheobronchial tree, with leakage of the contents into the pleural space.·       Abnormal hydrostatic or osmotic forces operating on an otherwise normal pleural surface and producing a transudate.

 INSTRUCTION Examine this patient's chest. SALIENT FEATURES History · Determine whether there is a reversible airway obstruction by history. Are the wheezing and breathlessness reversible? · Tightness in the chest. · Recurrent cough. · Exacerbation of the cough or wheeze at night or after exercise. · Improvement of the cough or wheeze with bronchodilator therapy. · Fever, yellowish sputum. · History of atopy (eczema, hay fever). · History of rhinitis, nasal polyps. Examination · Bilateral scattered wheeze. · Examine the sputum cup. · Comment on accessory muscles of respiration, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus and whether the patient can utter sentences without stopping to take a breath.

Question : 
What do you understand by the term 'asthma'?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of the airway epithelium.

 INSTRUCTION Examine this patient's chest. SALIENT FEATURES History · Sudden onset or rapidly progressive dyspnoea. · Ipsilateral acute pleuritic pain - the pain is either sharp or a steady ache. · A small pneumothorax may be asymptomatic. · Obtain history of recent pleural aspiration or insertion of subclavian line (J R Soc Med 1997: 90: 319-21), recent surgery to head and neck, abdominal procedures using bowel or peritoneal distension. · History of asthma, COAD, ARDS, pneumonia, trauma to chest. · History of Marfan's syndrome. · History of HIV. · History of positive pressure ventilation. Examination · Decreased movement of the affected side. · Increased percussion note. · Trachea may be central (small pneumothorax) or deviated to the affected side (underlying collapse of lung) or the opposite side (large pneumothorax). · Increased vocal resonance with diminished breath sounds. Proceed as follows: · Look for clues regarding aetiology: -Pleural aspiration site. -Infraclavicular region for a bruise from the central line. -Comment if the patient is thin or has marfanoid features. Inhaler or peak flow meter by the bedside (asthma, COAD). · Tell the examiner that you would suspect tension pneumothorax when there is tachycardia (>135 beats/minute), hypotension and pulsus paradoxus. DIAGNOSIS This patient has diminished breath sounds and hyper-resonant note on R/L side of the chest (lesion) due to pneumothorax secondary to Marfan's syndrome (aetiology), and is not breathless at rest (functional status).  
Question : 
How would you manage this patient?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 ·       Intravenous heparin.·       If the patient is young, manage with oral anticoagulants.·       If the patient is older, manage with oral anticoagulants and monitor blood pressure.·       If the patient is hypotensive, monitor blood pressure and treat hypotension with oral anticoagulants.·       If the patient is hypovolaemic, manage with oral anticoagulants and monitor blood pressure.
 
gold output :
 ·       Small pneumothoraces (less than 20% in size) spontaneously resolve withinweeks.·       Larger ones (irrespective of size) with normal lungs are managed by simple aspir-ation rather than an intercostal tube as theinitial drainage procedure. Aspiration is less painful than intercostal drainage, leads to a shorter admission and reduces theneed for pleurectomy with no increase in recurrence rate at 1 year.·       When there is rapid re-expansion following simple aspiration, an intercostal tube with underwater seal drainage is used. Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with several chest portsallows clear visualization of the pleural cavity for resection of bullae and pleurodesis.

Question : 
What do you understand by the term 'bronchiectasis sicca'?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 Bronchiectasis sicca is a chronic, progressive, bilateral, diffuse thickening of the bronchi, due to chronic inflammation of the alveolar epithelium.
 
gold output :
 Bronchiectasis or 'dry' bronchiectasis is that which presents with recurrent dry cough associated with intermittent episodes (months or years apart) of haemoptysis. The haemoptysis can be life threatening as bleeding is from bronchial vessels with systemic pressures. There is usually a past history of granulomatous infection, particularly tuberculosis. The upper lobes are often primarily affected, allowing good drainage.

Question : 
What is a pseudotumour?
 
Answer : 
 
predicted output :
 A pseudotumour is a non-cancerous tumour that is seen on CT scan as a large, non-contiguous mass on the pleura. It is seen most often in children and young adults, but occasionally in adults as well.
 
gold output :
 It is the accumulation of fluid between the major or minor fissure or along the lateral chest wall, and can be mistaken for a tumour onthe radiograph. Such loculated effusions can be confirmed with ultrasonography.
