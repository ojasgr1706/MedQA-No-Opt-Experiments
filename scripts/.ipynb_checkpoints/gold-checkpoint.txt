Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :Chest radiography (CXR)Standard posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs detect pleural fluid in excess of 175 ml. Obliteration of costophrenic angle tohemithorax suggests fluid. Sub-pulmonic effusion can simulate an elevated diaphragm.Pleural tap·       Pleural fluid for determination of the levels of protein, albumin, LDH, glucose, cholesterol and cytology. A simultaneous bloodsample should be obtained for estimation of glucose, protein, albumin and LDH.·       When empyema is suspected or seen, pleural fluid pH should be obtained.·       When tuberculosis is suspected, pleural fluid adenosine deaminase or lysozyme levels should be determined andZiehl-Neelsen staining and pleural fluid myco-bacterial cultures should be done.·       Pleural fluid amylase levels should be estimated when malignancy, pancreatitis or oesophageal rupture is suspected.·       In autoimmune disorders, pleural fluid rheumatoid factor or antinuclear anti-bodies should be tested.P!eural biopsyThe biopsy specimen is sent for histopathological examination and mycobacterial culture.

Question : 
How would you differentiate between an exudate and a transudate?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       The protein content of an exudate is more than 3 g/l. However, if this criterion alone is applied, about 10% of the exudates and15% of the transudates will be wrongly classified. A more accurate diagnosis is made when Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med1972; 77: 507-13) for an exudate are applied: (1) the ratio of the pleural fluid to serum protein is greater than 0.5; (2) the ratio ofpleural fluid to serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is greater than 0.6; (3) pleural fluid LDH is greater than two thirds the uppernormal limit for blood LDH levels. Roth et al (1990) found that, althomzh Light's criteria had a sensitivity of 100%, they had alow specificity of 72% (Chest 1990; 98: 546-9). This was due to the fact that many patients with effusion due to chronic cardiacfailure have protein values inthe exudate range, particularly when on chronic diuretic therapy. They found that the serum-effusion albumin gradient (i.e. serumalbumin minus pleural fluid albumin) was 95% sensitive but a more specific (100%) marker of exudative effusion. A gradient of lessthan 1.2 g/dl indicates an exudative effusion whereas a gradient greater than 1.2 g/dl indicates a transudative effusion.·       The pleural fluid cholesterol level is below 60 mg/dl in transudates. All malignant effusions have a pleural cholesterol levelgreater than this value, and therefore this test is useful to separate these two categories of effusion (Chest 1987; 92: 296-302;Chest1991; 99: 1097-102).

Question : 
What is the value of measuring pleural fluid pH and glucoseconcentrations in cases of malignant effusions?
 
Answer : 
answer :This is of value in determining the prognosis (Ann Intern Med 1988; 108: 345-9).Patients with a low pleural fluid pH (<7.3) or low glucose concentration (<60 mg/dl) have a shorter life expectancy than those withhigher values: 2.1 months versus 9.8 months. The low pH group tends to have more extensive pleural involvement as determined bythoracoscopy and a higher failure rate for chemical pleurodesis.

Question : 
What is the role of pleural fluid cytology in the diagnosis of pleural effusion ?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Pleural fluid usually contains about 1500 cells per gl (predominantly mono-nuclear cells). Counts above 50 000 are seen inparapneumonic effusions, whereas transudates usually have counts of less than 1000 cells per Itl.·       Pleural fluid eosinophilia, i.e. greater than 10%, suggests a benign disease, including pneumothorax, asbestos-relatedeffusions and post haemothorax, although malignancy cannot be excluded.·       Pleural fluid lymphocytosis is seen in about one third of transudates, in malignancy, tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vasculardiseases and sarcoidosis.·       Computerized interactive morphometry (analyses the size and nuclei of cells in a stained centrifuged specimen)differentiatesbetween malignant cells and reactive lymphocytosis. This method is particularly useful when differentiatingbetween benign reactive mesothelial cells and malignancy.

Question : 
What is the significance of pleural fluid amylase levels?
 
Answer : 
answer :A pleural fluid amylase level greater than the serum amylase concentration is seen in patients with pancreatitis, carcinoma, bacterialpneumonia and oesophageal rupture. In malignant effusions, when cytology cannot differentiate adenocarcinoma frommesothelioma, a raised amylase level suggests the presence of the former. Amylase-rich pleural effusions occur frequently, andpleural fluid isoamylase determination can be useful; the finding of a pleural effusion rich in salivary isoamylase should prompt anevaluation for carcinoma (particularly a lung primary), but may also be seen in other pleural inflammatory conditions (Chest 1992;102: 1455-9).

Question : 
What do you know about pleural disease in rheumatoid arthritis?
 
Answer : 
answer :About 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have pleural inflammation at autopsy and about 5% have radiological evidence ofpleural inflammation at some time. Pleural involvement is associated with male sex, rheumatoid factor in serum, the presence ofnodules and other systemic manifestations. The effusion is thought to develop as an inflammatory response to the presence ofmultiple subpleural nodules. For reasons that are entirely unclear, the left side is the more common site of unilateral rheumatoidpleural effusions. The pleural fluid glucose level is characteristically low and is said to be due to an 'entrance block' in which glucoseis unable to enter the pleural space, unlike in empyema and malignant effusions where the low pleural fluid glucose concentration isattributed to the increased use of glucose by cells. Cytological appearances of slender and elongated macrophages, round giantmultinucleated macrophages, presence of very few mesothelial cells and necrotic background material are thought to bepathognomonic of rheumatoid pleuritis.

Question : 
What is the role of inflammatory mechanisms in COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :Macrophages and epithelial cells in airways are activated by cigarette smoke and other irritants and release neutrophil chemotactic factors including interleukin-8 and leukotriene B4. Neutrophils and macrophages then release proteases that break down connective tissue in the lung parenchyma, resulting in emphysema, and also stimulate hypersecretion of bronchial mucus. The chronic inflammatory process in COPD differs markedly from that seen in bronchial asthma, with different inflam-matory cells, mediators, inflammatory effects and responses to treatment (Thorax 1998: 53:129 36; Chest 2000; 117 (suppl): 10S-14S).

Question : 
How would you treat acute respiratory failure?
 
Answer : 
answer :If Pao2 is less than 8 kPa, administer 24% oxygen. There is no need for oxygen when Pao2 is greater than 8 kPa. Monitor blood gases after 30 minutes. If Pa02 is rising (by I kPa), monitor blood gases hourly. If Pao2 continues to rise, administer doxapram. If, in spite of this, the patient continues to deteriorate, artificial ventilation may be called for.

Question : 
What do you know about non-invasive ventilation?
 
Answer : 
answer :Non-invasive ventilation is an alternative approach to endotracheal intubation to treat hypercapnic ventilatory failure which occurs in COAD. It thus reduces the complications of endotracheal intubation such as infection and injury to the trachea. Non-invasive ventilation is pressure-support ventilation delivered with a face mask and a piece of white foam placed in the face mask to reduce the amount of internal dead space. In a recent randomized trial, non-invasive ventilation was shown to reduce the need for endotracheal intubation, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality rate in selected patients with acute exacerbations of COAD (N Engl J Med 1995; 333: 817-22).

Question : 
What do you know about the molecular genetics of COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :ott-antitrypsin deficiency · It was first described in Sweden. The patient is deficient in alpha-antitrypsin, with activity approximately 15% that of the normal value; concentrations of 40% or more are required for health. The patient is homozygous for the protease inhibitor (Pi) ZZ gene. Other genetic combinations and their percentage normal activity are PiMS (80%), PiMZ (60%), PiSS (60%), PiSZ (40%). Six per cent of the population is heterozygous for S(PiMS) and 4% for Z(PiMZ), making an overall frequency of 1 in 10 for the carriage of the defective gene. Liver transplantation results in conversion to the genotype of the donor. · In the lung, alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits the excessive actions of neutrophil and macro-phage elastase, which cigarette smoke promotes. When the lung is heavily exposed to cigarette smoke, the protective effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin may be over-whelmed by the amount of elastase released or hy a direct oxidative action of cigarette smoke on the alpha 1 -antitrypsin molecule. The emphysema is panacinar and is seen in the lower lobes of the lungs. Smoking increases the severity and decreases the age of onset of emphysema. Liver disease is a much less common complication. Human alpha 1 -antltrypsm prepared from pooled plasma from normal donors is recommended for patients over 18 years with serum levels below 11 gmol/l and abnormal lung function. · The siblings of an index case should be screened for this disorder. Their identifi-cation should be followed by counselling to avoid smoking and occupations with atmospheric pollution. Children of homozygotes will inherit at least one Z gene and hence will be heterozygotes. They should avoid pairing with another heterozygote if they wish to avoid the risk of producing an affected homozygote. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) COAD is 10 times more common in Taiwanese with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for TNF-alpha resulting in increased production of TNF-alpha (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1997; 156:136-9). However, the same polymorphism in the UK population is not associated with increased risk of COAD (Eur Respir J 2000; 15: 2814). Microsomal epoxide hydrolase A polymorphism variant of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of epoxides that may be generated in tobacco smoke, has been associated with a quintupling of the risk of COAD (Lancet1997; 350: 663).

Question : 
What is the role of surgery in COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :· Bullectomy may improve gas exchange and airflow, and reduce dyspnoea in selected patients with bu]lae larger than one third of the hemithorax and accom-panying lung compression. · Lung-volume reduction surgery (N Engl J Med 2000; 343: 239-45) results in functional improvements including increased FEV1, reduced total lung capacity, improved function of respiratory muscles, improved exercise capacity and improved quality of life (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 112: 1319-29; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999; 160: 2018-27). These benefits persist for at least a year but the long-term benefits are not known and are currently being investigated by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Group (Chest 1999; 116: 1750-61). · Single lung transplantation: this has been successful for at least 34 years in patients with COAD. The criteria for selecting patients for transplantation have not been established. It does not improve survival but improves quality of life (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1991; 101: 623-32).

Question : 
What are the general indications for lung transplantation?
 
Answer : 
answer :The general indication is end-stage lung disease without alternative forms of therapy. Patients should be below 60 years of age and should have a life expectancy of less than 12 or 18 months; they should not have an underlying cancer or other serious systemic illness. The most common lung diseases are pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema (particularly alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency), bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary hypertension.

Question : 
How can CT assess bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
answer :High-resolution CT performed at the end of expiration suggests that small airways disease may be an early feature ofbronchiectasis, which leads to more progressive injury and bronchiolar distortion. Larger studies with long-term follow-up arerequired to confirm this. Conventional CT has a sensitivity of 60-80% for detecting bronchiectasis, whereas high-resolution CT has asensitivity of more than 90%, using bronchography as the 'gold standard'.

Question : 
What do you know about Reid's classification of bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
answer :In 1950, Reid correlated pathological changes with bronchography and described three different appearances. All three types can be present in the same patient. · Cylindrical bronchiectasis: refers to bronchi that are uniformly dilated and do not taper, but rather end abruptly. This is due to plugging of smaller bronchi by thick mucus and casts. The bronchi are dilated to greater than 2 mm but can be so large as to admit a finger. · Varicose bronchiectasis: refers to dilated bronchi with irregular bulging contours similar to a varicose vein. They do not taper and terminations are bulbous. Bronchial subdivisions are reduced. · Cystic or saccular bronchiectasis: the most severe form, characterized by sharply reduced bronchial subdivisions and dilated bronchi ending in cystic pus-filled cavities.

Question : 
How would you manage a patient with cor pulmonale?
 
Answer : 
answer :· Treat the underlying cause.·       Treat respiratory failure. If Pao, is less than 8 kPa, administer 24% oxygen. There is no need for oxygen if Pa(), is more than 8kPa. Monitor blood gases after 30 minutes. If PCO2, is rising (by I kPa), monitor blood gases hourly. If Pc(): continues to rise,administer doxapram. If, in spite of this, the deterioration continues, the patient may merit artificial ventilation.·       Treat cardiac failure with furosemide (frusemide).·       Consider venesection if the haematocrit is more than 55% (Lancet 1989; ii: 20 1 ).

Question : 
What do you know about pulmonary eosinophilic disorders?
 
Answer : 
answer :Crofton et al described five classes of pulmonary eosinophilic disorder (Thorax 1952; 7: 1-35):·       L6ffler's syndrome: characterized by transient pulmonary infiltrates and peri-pheral eosinophilia. It is associated with parasiticinfections, drug allergies and exposure to inorganic chemicals such as nickel carbonyl. The course is benign and respiratoryfailure almost unknown.·       Eosinophilia in asthmatics: the most common cause is allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. This condition is benign butchronic.·       Tropical eosinophilia which is secondary to filarial infection (Wuchereria bancrofti or W. malayi Brug).·       Churg Strauss syndrome. Diagnosis requires four of the following features: asthma; eosinophilia greater than 10%;mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy; paranasal sinus abnormality; non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates visible on chest radiographs;blood vessels with extravascular eosinophils found on biopsy.·       Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: chronic debilitating illness characterized by malaise, fever, weight loss and dyspnoea. Thechest radiograph shows a peri-pheral alveolar filling infiltrate predominantly in the upper lobes (the 'photo-graphic negative' ofpulmonary oedema).

Question : 
What do you know about broncbopulmonary sequestration?
 
Answer : 
answer :It is an uncommon congenital lesion in which a portion of non-functioning lung tissue is detached from the normal lung and suppliedby an anomalous systemic artery, usually arising from the aorta or one of its branches. The tissue has no communication with thebronchopulmonary tree. Two types of sequestration have been described: extralobar and intralobar. An extralobar sequestration hasits own pleural lining, which separates it from the remaining lung tissue, and the intralobar type shares its pleura with the adjacentnormal lung. Patients usually present in childhood with cough and recurrent pneumonia, and occasionally present with haemoptysis.

Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Sputum cytology: high yield for endobronchial tumours such as squamous cell and small cell carcinoma but poor yield foradenocarcinoma.·       CXR.·       Pleural fluid cytology.·       Bronchoscopy gives a high yield in excess of 90%, particularly when the tumour is viewed endobronchially. For tumours thatare not visualized , the yield for washing and brushing is about 75% in central lesions and 55% in peripheral lesions. The yieldin small-cell and squamous cell carcinomas is higher than in adenocarcinomas.·       CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen (to image the liver and adrenals).·       Bone scan for metastases (helpful in staging).·       PET scanning is highly sensitive and specific for mediastinal staging.·       Pulmonary function tests (most surgeons aim for a FEV1 of about I litre after planned resection); a DLCO below 60% predictedis associated with a mortality rate as high as 25% due to respiratory complications.

Question : 
What is the inheritance in cystic fibrosis?
 
Answer : 
answer :Autosomal recessive. On the long arm of chromosome 7 resides the gene coding for a 1480-amino-acid protein a cyclicAMP-regulated chloride channel, now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR). The CFTR gene iscarried by I in 20 Caucasians and its incidence is about 1 in 2000 live births. There is a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 7in 70% of patients. There is a deletion of the codon for phenylalanine at position 508 (A508; N Engl J Med 1990; 323:1517). Thisdetect leads to a failure of the chloride channel to open in response to cyclic AMP (Science 1992; 256: 774-9: N Engl d Med 1991;325: 575-7). More than 175 other types of lesion in the cystic fibrosis gene are responsible for the disease in the remaining 30% ofpatients.

Question : 
What is the basic defect in the airways of these patients?
 
Answer : 
answer :The opening of chloride channels at the luminal surface of the airway epithelial cells in normal individuals allows the passivetransport of chloride along an electro-chemical gradient from the cytoplasm to the lumen. In patients with cystic fibrosisthere is a defect in these channels which prevents the normal secretion of chloride into the airway lumen. Simultaneously, there is athree-fold increase in the reabsorp-tion of sodium from the airway lumen into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. As the movement ofwater into airway secretions follows the movement of salt, it is believed that a decreased secretion of chloride into the airway lumenand the increased reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen combine to reduce water content and increase the viscosity andtenacity of the airway secretions.

Question : 
What advice would you give a patient with cystic fibrosis who wishes to become pregnant?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       The couple will be offered genetic counselling and the man will be offered testing to determine his genetic status. If he is acarrier, chorionic villous sampling will be considered as the risk of the couple conceiving an infant with cystic fibrosis is I in 2and they may wish to consider selective termination in the first trimester. The hazards of general anaesthesia (as lung functionis impaired) for termination of pregnancy will be brought to their attention. Termination of pregnancy either with spinalanaesthesia or medications is an alternative.·       Women with severe disease will be informed that they may be unable to complete pregnancy and that their premature demisemay leave a motherless child.·       In women with an FEVj less than 60% of the predicted value there is an increased risk of premature delivery, an increased rateof caesarean section, some loss of lung function and risk of respiratory complications, and early death of the mother (BMJ1995; 311: 822-3).·       Pregnancy after heart-lung transplantation offers better health and increased longevity in the mother, but the risk of organrejection and exposure of the fetus to potentially teratogenic immunosuppressants means that pregnancy should not beattempted by women with transplants.

Question : 
What are the types of interstitial pneumonitis?
 
Answer : 
answer :Liebow and Carrington (Liebow AA, Carrington CB 1969 The interstitial pneumonias. In: Simon M, Potchen EJ, LeMay M (eds)Frontiers of Pulmonary Radiology. Grune &Stratton, New York, pp 102-141) initially described five subgroups, depending onhistology, to which there has recently been an addition:·       Classical (usual) interstitial pneumonia (UIP), characterized by thickening of the alveolar interstitium by fibrous tissue andmononuclear cells; characteristically varying in severity from one focus to another. The mean survival is 2.8-5.6 years. Twelveper cent respond to steroids and spontaneous improvement does not occur.·       Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) where there is a marked accumulation of macrophages in the alveolar airspacesassociated with a relatively mild but uniform thickening of the interstitial space caused by mononuclear inflammatory cells. Themean survival is 12.4-14 years. The response to steroids is 62% and spontaneous improvement is 22%.·       Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The survival is 14 years and thera-peutic response is similar to DIP.·       A diffuse lesion similar to UIP but with superimposed bronchiolitis obliterans.·       Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) in which there is marked infiltration of interstitium by lymphocytes that may beindistinguishable from lymphoma. ·Giant-cell interstitial pneumonia consisting of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the interstitium associated with large numbers ofmultinucleated giant cells.

DIAGNOSIS This patient has bilateral, basal, fine, end-inspiratory crackles (lesion) due to fibrosing alveolitis (aetiology) and is tachypnoeic at rest (functional status).  
Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       CXR typically shows bilateral basal reticulonodular shadows which advance upwards as the disease progresses. In advancedcases there is marked destruction of the parenchyma causing 'honeycombing' (due to groups of closely set ring shadows), andnodular shadows are not conspicuous. The mediastinum may appear broad as a result of a decrease in lung volume.·       Blood gases: arterial desaturation worsens while upright and improves on recum-bency. There is arterial hypoxaemia and hypocapnia.·       Pulmonary function tests: in the early stages lung volumes may be normal, but there is arterial desaturation following exercise.Typically there is a restrictive defect with reduction of both the gas transfer factor and gas transfer coefficient.·       High ESR; raised immunoglobulins; raised antinuclear factor; rheumatoid factoris positive.·       Bronchial lavage: a large number of lymphocytes indicates a good response to steroids and a good prognosis. A large numberof neutrophils and eosinophils indi-cates a poor prognosis (5-year survival rate of 60% for steroid responders versus 25% fornon-responders). The patients are more likely to respond to cyclophos-phamide if the number of neutrophils is increased (AmRev Respir Dis 1987; 135: 26).·       Lung biopsy: in early stages there is mononuclear cell infiltration in the alveolar walls, progressing to interstitial fibrosis - knownas usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP); in later stages fibrotic contraction of the lung, honeycombing, bronchial dilatation andcysts are seen. DIP - alveolar macrophages with little mononuclear infiltration or fibrosis - has a better prognosis than UIP as itresponds to steroids.·       MRI is useful in determining disease activity without ionizing radiation but it isan expensive method. · High-resolution CT (HRCT) is useful to assess the pattern and extent of disease. Patients with a predominantly ground-glassappearance are treated whereas those with a predominantly reticular appearance undergo technetium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate scanning (DPTA) to assess the probability of deterioration. HRCT may avoid the need for biopsy, especially ifthere is predominantly reticular shadowing. It acts as a guide for ideal biopsy site.·       Technetium-99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DPTA) scanning in non-smokers is of value in identifying which patients aremore likely to deteriorate. Therapy can be postponed when there is slow clearance, whereas those with fast clearance shouldreceive treatment (Eur Respir J 1993; 6: 797-802).

If response is good, continue; if no response then taper over 1 week.·       Steroid non-responders may benefit from a course of cyclophosphamide.

Question : 
What is the role of MRI of the thorax?
 
Answer : 
answer :MRI of the thorax is less useful than CT scanning because of poorer imaging of the pulmonary parenchyma and inferior spatial resolution. However, MRI can provide images in multiple planes (e.g. sagittal, coronal as well as transverse) which CT can not. MRI is excellent for evaluating processes near the lung apex, spine and thoraco-abdominal junction.

Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       CXR, both inspiratory and expiratory phases. In critically ill patients pneumo-thorax is suspected when (a) the costophrenicangle extends more inferiorly than usual due to air- the 'deep sulcus sign' (Radiology 1980; 136: 25-7), (b) liver appears moreradiolucent due to air in the CP angle, or on the left side, when the air will outline the medial aspect of the hemidiaphragmunder the heart.·       Blood gases if the patient is breathless: hypoxaemia depending on the shunting,whereas hypercapnia does not develop.

Question : 
How would you manage this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Small pneumothoraces (less than 20% in size) spontaneously resolve withinweeks.·       Larger ones (irrespective of size) with normal lungs are managed by simple aspir-ation rather than an intercostal tube as theinitial drainage procedure. Aspiration is less painful than intercostal drainage, leads to a shorter admission and reduces theneed for pleurectomy with no increase in recurrence rate at 1 year.·       When there is rapid re-expansion following simple aspiration, an intercostal tube with underwater seal drainage is used. Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with several chest portsallows clear visualization of the pleural cavity for resection of bullae and pleurodesis.

Question : 
How would you differentiate between an exudate and a transudate?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       The protein content of an exudate is more than 3 g/l. However, if this criterion alone is applied, about 10% of the exudates and15% of the transudates will be wrongly classified. A more accurate diagnosis is made when Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med1972; 77: 507-13) for an exudate are applied: (1) the ratio of the pleural fluid to serum protein is greater than 0.5; (2) the ratio ofpleural fluid to serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is greater than 0.6; (3) pleural fluid LDH is greater than two thirds the uppernormal limit for blood LDH levels. Roth et al (1990) found that, althomzh Light's criteria had a sensitivity of 100%, they had alow specificity of 72% (Chest 1990; 98: 546-9). This was due to the fact that many patients with effusion due to chronic cardiacfailure have protein values inthe exudate range, particularly when on chronic diuretic therapy. They found that the serum-effusion albumin gradient (i.e. serumalbumin minus pleural fluid albumin) was 95% sensitive but a more specific (100%) marker of exudative effusion. A gradient of lessthan 1.2 g/dl indicates an exudative effusion whereas a gradient greater than 1.2 g/dl indicates a transudative effusion.·       The pleural fluid cholesterol level is below 60 mg/dl in transudates. All malignant effusions have a pleural cholesterol levelgreater than this value, and therefore this test is useful to separate these two categories of effusion (Chest 1987; 92: 296-302;Chest1991; 99: 1097-102).

Question : 
What is the value of measuring pleural fluid pH and glucoseconcentrations in cases of malignant effusions?
 
Answer : 
answer :This is of value in determining the prognosis (Ann Intern Med 1988; 108: 345-9).Patients with a low pleural fluid pH (<7.3) or low glucose concentration (<60 mg/dl) have a shorter life expectancy than those withhigher values: 2.1 months versus 9.8 months. The low pH group tends to have more extensive pleural involvement as determined bythoracoscopy and a higher failure rate for chemical pleurodesis.

Question : 
What is the role of pleural fluid cytology in the diagnosis of pleural effusion ?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Pleural fluid usually contains about 1500 cells per gl (predominantly mono-nuclear cells). Counts above 50 000 are seen inparapneumonic effusions, whereas transudates usually have counts of less than 1000 cells per Itl.·       Pleural fluid eosinophilia, i.e. greater than 10%, suggests a benign disease, including pneumothorax, asbestos-relatedeffusions and post haemothorax, although malignancy cannot be excluded.·       Pleural fluid lymphocytosis is seen in about one third of transudates, in malignancy, tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vasculardiseases and sarcoidosis.·       Computerized interactive morphometry (analyses the size and nuclei of cells in a stained centrifuged specimen)differentiatesbetween malignant cells and reactive lymphocytosis. This method is particularly useful when differentiatingbetween benign reactive mesothelial cells and malignancy.

Question : 
What is the significance of pleural fluid amylase levels?
 
Answer : 
answer :A pleural fluid amylase level greater than the serum amylase concentration is seen in patients with pancreatitis, carcinoma, bacterialpneumonia and oesophageal rupture. In malignant effusions, when cytology cannot differentiate adenocarcinoma frommesothelioma, a raised amylase level suggests the presence of the former. Amylase-rich pleural effusions occur frequently, andpleural fluid isoamylase determination can be useful; the finding of a pleural effusion rich in salivary isoamylase should prompt anevaluation for carcinoma (particularly a lung primary), but may also be seen in other pleural inflammatory conditions (Chest 1992;102: 1455-9).

Question : 
What do you know about pleural disease in rheumatoid arthritis?
 
Answer : 
answer :About 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have pleural inflammation at autopsy and about 5% have radiological evidence ofpleural inflammation at some time. Pleural involvement is associated with male sex, rheumatoid factor in serum, the presence ofnodules and other systemic manifestations. The effusion is thought to develop as an inflammatory response to the presence ofmultiple subpleural nodules. For reasons that are entirely unclear, the left side is the more common site of unilateral rheumatoidpleural effusions. The pleural fluid glucose level is characteristically low and is said to be due to an 'entrance block' in which glucoseis unable to enter the pleural space, unlike in empyema and malignant effusions where the low pleural fluid glucose concentration isattributed to the increased use of glucose by cells. Cytological appearances of slender and elongated macrophages, round giantmultinucleated macrophages, presence of very few mesothelial cells and necrotic background material are thought to bepathognomonic of rheumatoid pleuritis.

Question : 
What is the role of inflammatory mechanisms in COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :Macrophages and epithelial cells in airways are activated by cigarette smoke and other irritants and release neutrophil chemotactic factors including interleukin-8 and leukotriene B4. Neutrophils and macrophages then release proteases that break down connective tissue in the lung parenchyma, resulting in emphysema, and also stimulate hypersecretion of bronchial mucus. The chronic inflammatory process in COPD differs markedly from that seen in bronchial asthma, with different inflam-matory cells, mediators, inflammatory effects and responses to treatment (Thorax 1998: 53:129 36; Chest 2000; 117 (suppl): 10S-14S).

Question : 
What is the role of high-resolution CT in the diagnosis of emphysema ? 
 
Answer : 
answer :It is the most sensitive (but expensive) technique for the diagnosis of emphysema. It is useful in evaluating symptomatic patients with almost normal pulmonary function except for a low carbon monoxide diffusing capacity - a combination of findings that occurs in emphysema, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular disease (Radiology 1992; 182:817-21 ).

Question : 
How would you treat acute respiratory failure?
 
Answer : 
answer :If Pao2 is less than 8 kPa, administer 24% oxygen. There is no need for oxygen when Pao2 is greater than 8 kPa. Monitor blood gases after 30 minutes. If Pa02 is rising (by I kPa), monitor blood gases hourly. If Pao2 continues to rise, administer doxapram. If, in spite of this, the patient continues to deteriorate, artificial ventilation may be called for.

Question : 
What do you know about non-invasive ventilation?
 
Answer : 
answer :Non-invasive ventilation is an alternative approach to endotracheal intubation to treat hypercapnic ventilatory failure which occurs in COAD. It thus reduces the complications of endotracheal intubation such as infection and injury to the trachea. Non-invasive ventilation is pressure-support ventilation delivered with a face mask and a piece of white foam placed in the face mask to reduce the amount of internal dead space. In a recent randomized trial, non-invasive ventilation was shown to reduce the need for endotracheal intubation, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality rate in selected patients with acute exacerbations of COAD (N Engl J Med 1995; 333: 817-22).

Question : 
What do you know about the molecular genetics of COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :ott-antitrypsin deficiency · It was first described in Sweden. The patient is deficient in alpha-antitrypsin, with activity approximately 15% that of the normal value; concentrations of 40% or more are required for health. The patient is homozygous for the protease inhibitor (Pi) ZZ gene. Other genetic combinations and their percentage normal activity are PiMS (80%), PiMZ (60%), PiSS (60%), PiSZ (40%). Six per cent of the population is heterozygous for S(PiMS) and 4% for Z(PiMZ), making an overall frequency of 1 in 10 for the carriage of the defective gene. Liver transplantation results in conversion to the genotype of the donor. · In the lung, alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits the excessive actions of neutrophil and macro-phage elastase, which cigarette smoke promotes. When the lung is heavily exposed to cigarette smoke, the protective effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin may be over-whelmed by the amount of elastase released or hy a direct oxidative action of cigarette smoke on the alpha 1 -antitrypsin molecule. The emphysema is panacinar and is seen in the lower lobes of the lungs. Smoking increases the severity and decreases the age of onset of emphysema. Liver disease is a much less common complication. Human alpha 1 -antltrypsm prepared from pooled plasma from normal donors is recommended for patients over 18 years with serum levels below 11 gmol/l and abnormal lung function. · The siblings of an index case should be screened for this disorder. Their identifi-cation should be followed by counselling to avoid smoking and occupations with atmospheric pollution. Children of homozygotes will inherit at least one Z gene and hence will be heterozygotes. They should avoid pairing with another heterozygote if they wish to avoid the risk of producing an affected homozygote. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) COAD is 10 times more common in Taiwanese with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for TNF-alpha resulting in increased production of TNF-alpha (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1997; 156:136-9). However, the same polymorphism in the UK population is not associated with increased risk of COAD (Eur Respir J 2000; 15: 2814). Microsomal epoxide hydrolase A polymorphism variant of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of epoxides that may be generated in tobacco smoke, has been associated with a quintupling of the risk of COAD (Lancet1997; 350: 663).

Question : 
What is the role of surgery in COAD?
 
Answer : 
answer :· Bullectomy may improve gas exchange and airflow, and reduce dyspnoea in selected patients with bu]lae larger than one third of the hemithorax and accom-panying lung compression. · Lung-volume reduction surgery (N Engl J Med 2000; 343: 239-45) results in functional improvements including increased FEV1, reduced total lung capacity, improved function of respiratory muscles, improved exercise capacity and improved quality of life (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 112: 1319-29; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999; 160: 2018-27). These benefits persist for at least a year but the long-term benefits are not known and are currently being investigated by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Group (Chest 1999; 116: 1750-61). · Single lung transplantation: this has been successful for at least 34 years in patients with COAD. The criteria for selecting patients for transplantation have not been established. It does not improve survival but improves quality of life (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1991; 101: 623-32).

Question : 
What are the general indications for lung transplantation?
 
Answer : 
answer :The general indication is end-stage lung disease without alternative forms of therapy. Patients should be below 60 years of age and should have a life expectancy of less than 12 or 18 months; they should not have an underlying cancer or other serious systemic illness. The most common lung diseases are pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema (particularly alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency), bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary hypertension.

Question : 
How can CT assess bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
answer :High-resolution CT performed at the end of expiration suggests that small airways disease may be an early feature ofbronchiectasis, which leads to more progressive injury and bronchiolar distortion. Larger studies with long-term follow-up arerequired to confirm this. Conventional CT has a sensitivity of 60-80% for detecting bronchiectasis, whereas high-resolution CT has asensitivity of more than 90%, using bronchography as the 'gold standard'.

Question : 
What do you understand by the term 'bronchiectasis sicca'?
 
Answer : 
answer :Bronchiectasis or 'dry' bronchiectasis is that which presents with recurrent dry cough associated with intermittent episodes (months or years apart) of haemoptysis. The haemoptysis can be life threatening as bleeding is from bronchial vessels with systemic pressures. There is usually a past history of granulomatous infection, particularly tuberculosis. The upper lobes are often primarily affected, allowing good drainage.

Question : 
What do you know about Reid's classification of bronchiectasis?
 
Answer : 
answer :In 1950, Reid correlated pathological changes with bronchography and described three different appearances. All three types can be present in the same patient. · Cylindrical bronchiectasis: refers to bronchi that are uniformly dilated and do not taper, but rather end abruptly. This is due to plugging of smaller bronchi by thick mucus and casts. The bronchi are dilated to greater than 2 mm but can be so large as to admit a finger. · Varicose bronchiectasis: refers to dilated bronchi with irregular bulging contours similar to a varicose vein. They do not taper and terminations are bulbous. Bronchial subdivisions are reduced. · Cystic or saccular bronchiectasis: the most severe form, characterized by sharply reduced bronchial subdivisions and dilated bronchi ending in cystic pus-filled cavities.

Question : 
How would you manage a patient with cor pulmonale?
 
Answer : 
answer :· Treat the underlying cause.·       Treat respiratory failure. If Pao, is less than 8 kPa, administer 24% oxygen. There is no need for oxygen if Pa(), is more than 8kPa. Monitor blood gases after 30 minutes. If PCO2, is rising (by I kPa), monitor blood gases hourly. If Pc(): continues to rise,administer doxapram. If, in spite of this, the deterioration continues, the patient may merit artificial ventilation.·       Treat cardiac failure with furosemide (frusemide).·       Consider venesection if the haematocrit is more than 55% (Lancet 1989; ii: 20 1 ).

What do you know about pulmonary eosinophilic disorders?
 
Answer : 
answer :Crofton et al described five classes of pulmonary eosinophilic disorder (Thorax 1952; 7: 1-35):·       L6ffler's syndrome: characterized by transient pulmonary infiltrates and peri-pheral eosinophilia. It is associated with parasiticinfections, drug allergies and exposure to inorganic chemicals such as nickel carbonyl. The course is benign and respiratoryfailure almost unknown.·       Eosinophilia in asthmatics: the most common cause is allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. This condition is benign butchronic.·       Tropical eosinophilia which is secondary to filarial infection (Wuchereria bancrofti or W. malayi Brug).·       Churg Strauss syndrome. Diagnosis requires four of the following features: asthma; eosinophilia greater than 10%;mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy; paranasal sinus abnormality; non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates visible on chest radiographs;blood vessels with extravascular eosinophils found on biopsy.·       Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: chronic debilitating illness characterized by malaise, fever, weight loss and dyspnoea. Thechest radiograph shows a peri-pheral alveolar filling infiltrate predominantly in the upper lobes (the 'photo-graphic negative' ofpulmonary oedema).

Question : 
What do you know about broncbopulmonary sequestration?
 
Answer : 
answer :It is an uncommon congenital lesion in which a portion of non-functioning lung tissue is detached from the normal lung and suppliedby an anomalous systemic artery, usually arising from the aorta or one of its branches. The tissue has no communication with thebronchopulmonary tree. Two types of sequestration have been described: extralobar and intralobar. An extralobar sequestration hasits own pleural lining, which separates it from the remaining lung tissue, and the intralobar type shares its pleura with the adjacentnormal lung. Patients usually present in childhood with cough and recurrent pneumonia, and occasionally present with haemoptysis.

Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Sputum cytology: high yield for endobronchial tumours such as squamous cell and small cell carcinoma but poor yield foradenocarcinoma.·       CXR.·       Pleural fluid cytology.·       Bronchoscopy gives a high yield in excess of 90%, particularly when the tumour is viewed endobronchially. For tumours thatare not visualized , the yield for washing and brushing is about 75% in central lesions and 55% in peripheral lesions. The yieldin small-cell and squamous cell carcinomas is higher than in adenocarcinomas.·       CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen (to image the liver and adrenals).·       Bone scan for metastases (helpful in staging).·       PET scanning is highly sensitive and specific for mediastinal staging.·       Pulmonary function tests (most surgeons aim for a FEV1 of about I litre after planned resection); a DLCO below 60% predictedis associated with a mortality rate as high as 25% due to respiratory complications.

Question : 
What is the inheritance in cystic fibrosis?
 
Answer : 
answer :Autosomal recessive. On the long arm of chromosome 7 resides the gene coding for a 1480-amino-acid protein a cyclicAMP-regulated chloride channel, now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR). The CFTR gene iscarried by I in 20 Caucasians and its incidence is about 1 in 2000 live births. There is a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 7in 70% of patients. There is a deletion of the codon for phenylalanine at position 508 (A508; N Engl J Med 1990; 323:1517). Thisdetect leads to a failure of the chloride channel to open in response to cyclic AMP (Science 1992; 256: 774-9: N Engl d Med 1991;325: 575-7). More than 175 other types of lesion in the cystic fibrosis gene are responsible for the disease in the remaining 30% ofpatients.

Question : 
What is the basic defect in the airways of these patients?
 
Answer : 
answer :The opening of chloride channels at the luminal surface of the airway epithelial cells in normal individuals allows the passivetransport of chloride along an electro-chemical gradient from the cytoplasm to the lumen. In patients with cystic fibrosisthere is a defect in these channels which prevents the normal secretion of chloride into the airway lumen. Simultaneously, there is athree-fold increase in the reabsorp-tion of sodium from the airway lumen into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. As the movement ofwater into airway secretions follows the movement of salt, it is believed that a decreased secretion of chloride into the airway lumenand the increased reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen combine to reduce water content and increase the viscosity andtenacity of the airway secretions.

Question : 
What new methods of treatment are available?
 
Answer : 
answer :· High-dose ibuprofen in patients with mild disease (FEVi of at least 60% of the predicted value), taken consistently for 4 years,significantly slows the progression of lung disease without serious adverse effects (N Engl J Med 1995; 332: 848-54).·       Aerosolized recombinant human DNAse, which is capable of degrading DNA in the bronchial secretion, has been shown toimprove forced expiratory flow rates when given by aerosol (N Engl J Med 1994; 331: 637-42).·       Gene therapy: the gene is transferred in a 'carder' (either in a cationic lipid envelope known as a liposome (Nat Med1995; 1:39-46), or in an adenovirus). On trans-ferdng the gene for cystic fibrosis to the nasal epithelium using a cationic liposome, thedeficit was partly restored without provoking a local inflammatory response.·       Improvement of the hydration of secretion:- By blocking the reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen with amiloride. -By stimulating the secretion of chloride withtriphosphate nucleotides (ATP oruridine triphosphate) through nucleotide receptors by a pathway independent of cylic AMP metabolism (N Engl J Med 1991;322:1189-94).· Immunization to various components of Pseudomonas.

Question : 
What advice would you give a patient with cystic fibrosis who wishes to become pregnant?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       The couple will be offered genetic counselling and the man will be offered testing to determine his genetic status. If he is acarrier, chorionic villous sampling will be considered as the risk of the couple conceiving an infant with cystic fibrosis is I in 2and they may wish to consider selective termination in the first trimester. The hazards of general anaesthesia (as lung functionis impaired) for termination of pregnancy will be brought to their attention. Termination of pregnancy either with spinalanaesthesia or medications is an alternative.·       Women with severe disease will be informed that they may be unable to complete pregnancy and that their premature demisemay leave a motherless child.·       In women with an FEVj less than 60% of the predicted value there is an increased risk of premature delivery, an increased rateof caesarean section, some loss of lung function and risk of respiratory complications, and early death of the mother (BMJ1995; 311: 822-3).·       Pregnancy after heart-lung transplantation offers better health and increased longevity in the mother, but the risk of organrejection and exposure of the fetus to potentially teratogenic immunosuppressants means that pregnancy should not beattempted by women with transplants.

Question : 
What are the types of interstitial pneumonitis?
 
Answer : 
answer :Liebow and Carrington (Liebow AA, Carrington CB 1969 The interstitial pneumonias. In: Simon M, Potchen EJ, LeMay M (eds)Frontiers of Pulmonary Radiology. Grune &Stratton, New York, pp 102-141) initially described five subgroups, depending onhistology, to which there has recently been an addition:·       Classical (usual) interstitial pneumonia (UIP), characterized by thickening of the alveolar interstitium by fibrous tissue andmononuclear cells; characteristically varying in severity from one focus to another. The mean survival is 2.8-5.6 years. Twelveper cent respond to steroids and spontaneous improvement does not occur.·       Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) where there is a marked accumulation of macrophages in the alveolar airspacesassociated with a relatively mild but uniform thickening of the interstitial space caused by mononuclear inflammatory cells. Themean survival is 12.4-14 years. The response to steroids is 62% and spontaneous improvement is 22%.·       Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The survival is 14 years and thera-peutic response is similar to DIP.·       A diffuse lesion similar to UIP but with superimposed bronchiolitis obliterans.·       Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) in which there is marked infiltration of interstitium by lymphocytes that may beindistinguishable from lymphoma. ·Giant-cell interstitial pneumonia consisting of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the interstitium associated with large numbers ofmultinucleated giant cells.

Question : 
How would you investigate this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       CXR typically shows bilateral basal reticulonodular shadows which advance upwards as the disease progresses. In advancedcases there is marked destruction of the parenchyma causing 'honeycombing' (due to groups of closely set ring shadows), andnodular shadows are not conspicuous. The mediastinum may appear broad as a result of a decrease in lung volume.·       Blood gases: arterial desaturation worsens while upright and improves on recum-bency. There is arterial hypoxaemia and hypocapnia.·       Pulmonary function tests: in the early stages lung volumes may be normal, but there is arterial desaturation following exercise.Typically there is a restrictive defect with reduction of both the gas transfer factor and gas transfer coefficient.·       High ESR; raised immunoglobulins; raised antinuclear factor; rheumatoid factoris positive.·       Bronchial lavage: a large number of lymphocytes indicates a good response to steroids and a good prognosis. A large numberof neutrophils and eosinophils indi-cates a poor prognosis (5-year survival rate of 60% for steroid responders versus 25% fornon-responders). The patients are more likely to respond to cyclophos-phamide if the number of neutrophils is increased (AmRev Respir Dis 1987; 135: 26).·       Lung biopsy: in early stages there is mononuclear cell infiltration in the alveolar walls, progressing to interstitial fibrosis - knownas usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP); in later stages fibrotic contraction of the lung, honeycombing, bronchial dilatation andcysts are seen. DIP - alveolar macrophages with little mononuclear infiltration or fibrosis - has a better prognosis than UIP as itresponds to steroids.·       MRI is useful in determining disease activity without ionizing radiation but it isan expensive method. · High-resolution CT (HRCT) is useful to assess the pattern and extent of disease. Patients with a predominantly ground-glassappearance are treated whereas those with a predominantly reticular appearance undergo technetium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate scanning (DPTA) to assess the probability of deterioration. HRCT may avoid the need for biopsy, especially ifthere is predominantly reticular shadowing. It acts as a guide for ideal biopsy site.·       Technetium-99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DPTA) scanning in non-smokers is of value in identifying which patients aremore likely to deteriorate. Therapy can be postponed when there is slow clearance, whereas those with fast clearance shouldreceive treatment (Eur Respir J 1993; 6: 797-802).

If response is good, continue; if no response then taper over 1 week.·       Steroid non-responders may benefit from a course of cyclophosphamide.

Question : 
What is the role of MRI of the thorax?
 
Answer : 
answer :MRI of the thorax is less useful than CT scanning because of poorer imaging of the pulmonary parenchyma and inferior spatial resolution. However, MRI can provide images in multiple planes (e.g. sagittal, coronal as well as transverse) which CT can not. MRI is excellent for evaluating processes near the lung apex, spine and thoraco-abdominal junction.

Question : 
How would you manage this patient?
 
Answer : 
answer :·       Small pneumothoraces (less than 20% in size) spontaneously resolve withinweeks.·       Larger ones (irrespective of size) with normal lungs are managed by simple aspir-ation rather than an intercostal tube as theinitial drainage procedure. Aspiration is less painful than intercostal drainage, leads to a shorter admission and reduces theneed for pleurectomy with no increase in recurrence rate at 1 year.·       When there is rapid re-expansion following simple aspiration, an intercostal tube with underwater seal drainage is used. Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with several chest portsallows clear visualization of the pleural cavity for resection of bullae and pleurodesis.

Examination · Trachea deviated to the affected side. · Movements decreased on the affected side. · Percussion note dull on the affected side. · Breath sounds diminished on the affected side. Proceed as follows: Tell the examiner that you would like to look for tar staining (tobacco smoking), clubbing and cachexia (bronchogenic carcinoma, see pp 274-6). DIAGNOSIS This patient has a collapsed lung (lesion); you would like to exclude malignancy (aetiology). He is breathless at rest (functional status).  
Question : 
What are the causes of lung collapse?
 
Answer : 
answer :These include:·       Bronchogenic carcinoma.·       Mucus plugs (asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; BMJ1982; 285: 552).·       Extrinsic compression from hilar adenopathy (e.g. primary TB).·       Tuberculosis (Brock's syndrome).·       Other intrabronchial tumours including bronchial adenoma.
