With extensive air trapping in\\nobstructive lung disease, TLC is often increased, and RV may also be increased. Vital capacity\\n(VC) is proportionally decreased. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measures respiratory\\nmuscle strength and is decreased in patients with neuromuscular disease. Thus, myasthenia\\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio.

       "  'explanation': 'In this patient presenting with multilobar pneumonia,\\nhypoxemia is present that does not correct with increasing the concentration of inspired oxygen.\\nThe inability to overcome hypoxemia or the lack of a notable increase in partial pressure of\\narterial oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen saturation (SaO2) with increasing fraction of inspired oxygen\\nphysiologically defines a shunt. A shunt occurs when deoxygenated blood is transported to the\\nleft heart and systemic circulation without having the capability of becoming oxygenated. Causes\\nof shunt include alveolar collapse (atelectasis), intra-alveolar filling processes, intrapulmonary\\nvascular malformations, or structural cardiac disease leading to right-to-left shunt. In this case,\\nthe patient has multilobar pneumonia leading to alveoli that are being perfused but unable to\\nparticipate in gas exchange because they are filled with pus and inflammatory exudates. Acute\\nrespiratory distress syndrome is another common cause of shunt physiology. V/Q mismatch is\\nthe most common cause of hypoxemia and results when there are some alveolar units with low\\nratios (low ventilation to perfusion) that fail to fully oxygenate perfused blood. When blood is\\nreturned to the left heart, the poorly oxygenated blood admixes with blood from normal alveolar\\nunits. The resultant hypoxemia is less severe than with shunt and can be corrected with\\nincreasing the inspired oxygen concentration. Hypoventilation with or without other causes of\\nhypoxemia is not present in this case, as the PCO2 <40 mmHg indicates hyperventilation. The\\nacidosis present in this case is of a metabolic rather than a pulmonary source. Because the\\npatient is paralyzed, she is unable to increase her respiratory rate above the set rate to\\ncompensate for the metabolic acidosis.'}]"

A\\ndecreased FEV1/FVC ratio is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases. Alternatively, low lung\\nvolumes, specifically decreased total lung capacity (TLC), and occasionally decreased residual\\nvolume (RV) are characteristic of restrictive lung diseases. With extensive air trapping in\\nobstructive lung disease, TLC is often increased, and RV may also be increased. Vital capacity\\n(VC) is proportionally decreased. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measures respiratory\\nmuscle strength and is decreased in patients with neuromuscular disease. Thus, myasthenia\\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio.

       "  'answer': 'C',\n",
       "  'explanation': 'In this patient presenting with multilobar pneumonia,\\nhypoxemia is present that does not correct with increasing the concentration of inspired oxygen.\\nThe inability to overcome hypoxemia or the lack of a notable increase in partial pressure of\\narterial oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen saturation (SaO2) with increasing fraction of inspired oxygen\\nphysiologically defines a shunt. A shunt occurs when deoxygenated blood is transported to the\\nleft heart and systemic circulation without having the capability of becoming oxygenated. Causes\\nof shunt include alveolar collapse (atelectasis), intra-alveolar filling processes, intrapulmonary\\nvascular malformations, or structural cardiac disease leading to right-to-left shunt. In this case,\\nthe patient has multilobar pneumonia leading to alveoli that are being perfused but unable to\\nparticipate in gas exchange because they are filled with pus and inflammatory exudates. Acute\\nrespiratory distress syndrome is another common cause of shunt physiology. V/Q mismatch is\\nthe most common cause of hypoxemia and results when there are some alveolar units with low\\nratios (low ventilation to perfusion) that fail to fully oxygenate perfused blood. When blood is\\nreturned to the left heart, the poorly oxygenated blood admixes with blood from normal alveolar\\nunits. The resultant hypoxemia is less severe than with shunt and can be corrected with\\nincreasing the inspired oxygen concentration. Hypoventilation with or without other causes of\\nhypoxemia is not present in this case, as the PCO2 <40 mmHg indicates hyperventilation. The\\nacidosis present in this case is of a metabolic rather than a pulmonary source. Because the\\npatient is paralyzed, she is unable to increase her respiratory rate above the set rate to\\ncompensate for the metabolic acidosis.'}]"
