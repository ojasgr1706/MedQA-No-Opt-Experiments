       "  'ans': \"·       The protein content of an exudate is more than 3 g/l. However, if this criterion alone is applied, about 10% of the exudates and15% of the transudates will be wrongly classified. A more accurate diagnosis is made when Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med1972; 77: 507-13) for an exudate are applied: (1) the ratio of the pleural fluid to serum protein is greater than 0.5; (2) the ratio ofpleural fluid to serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is greater than 0.6; (3) pleural fluid LDH is greater than two thirds the uppernormal limit for blood LDH levels. Roth et al (1990) found that, althomzh Light's criteria had a sensitivity of 100%, they had alow specificity of 72% (Chest 1990; 98: 546-9). This was due to the fact that many patients with effusion due to chronic cardiacfailure have protein values inthe exudate range, particularly when on chronic diuretic therapy. They found that the serum-effusion albumin gradient (i.e. serumalbumin minus pleural fluid albumin) was 95% sensitive but a more specific (100%) marker of exudative effusion. A gradient of lessthan 1.2 g/dl indicates an exudative effusion whereas a gradient greater than 1.2 g/dl indicates a transudative effusion.·       The pleural fluid cholesterol level is below 60 mg/dl in transudates. All malignant effusions have a pleural cholesterol levelgreater than this value, and therefore this test is useful to separate these two categories of effusion (Chest 1987; 92: 296-302;Chest1991; 99: 1097-102).\\n\"},\n",

       "  'ques': 'What do you know about the molecular genetics of COAD?\\n',\n",
       "  'ans': 'ott-antitrypsin deficiency · It was first described in Sweden. The patient is deficient in alpha-antitrypsin, with activity approximately 15% that of the normal value; concentrations of 40% or more are required for health. The patient is homozygous for the protease inhibitor (Pi) ZZ gene. Other genetic combinations and their percentage normal activity are PiMS (80%), PiMZ (60%), PiSS (60%), PiSZ (40%). Six per cent of the population is heterozygous for S(PiMS) and 4% for Z(PiMZ), making an overall frequency of 1 in 10 for the carriage of the defective gene. Liver transplantation results in conversion to the genotype of the donor. · In the lung, alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits the excessive actions of neutrophil and macro-phage elastase, which cigarette smoke promotes. When the lung is heavily exposed to cigarette smoke, the protective effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin may be over-whelmed by the amount of elastase released or hy a direct oxidative action of cigarette smoke on the alpha 1 -antitrypsin molecule. The emphysema is panacinar and is seen in the lower lobes of the lungs. Smoking increases the severity and decreases the age of onset of emphysema. Liver disease is a much less common complication. Human alpha 1 -antltrypsm prepared from pooled plasma from normal donors is recommended for patients over 18 years with serum levels below 11 gmol/l and abnormal lung function. · The siblings of an index case should be screened for this disorder. Their identifi-cation should be followed by counselling to avoid smoking and occupations with atmospheric pollution. Children of homozygotes will inherit at least one Z gene and hence will be heterozygotes. They should avoid pairing with another heterozygote if they wish to avoid the risk of producing an affected homozygote. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) COAD is 10 times more common in Taiwanese with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for TNF-alpha resulting in increased production of TNF-alpha (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1997; 156:136-9). However, the same polymorphism in the UK population is not associated with increased risk of COAD (Eur Respir J 2000; 15: 2814). Microsomal epoxide hydrolase A polymorphism variant of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of epoxides that may be generated in tobacco smoke, has been associated with a quintupling of the risk of COAD (Lancet1997; 350: 663). \\n'},\n",

There is a deletion of the codon for phenylalanine at position 508 (A508; N Engl J Med 1990; 323:1517). Thisdetect leads to a failure of the chloride channel to open in response to cyclic AMP (Science 1992; 256: 774-9: N Engl d Med 1991;325: 575-7).

Simultaneously, there is athree-fold increase in the reabsorp-tion of sodium from the airway lumen into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. As the movement ofwater into airway secretions follows the movement of salt, it is believed that a decreased secretion of chloride into the airway lumenand the increased reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen combine to reduce water content and increase the viscosity andtenacity of the airway secretions.\\n'},\n",

       "  'ans': \"·       CXR typically shows bilateral basal reticulonodular shadows which advance upwards as the disease progresses. In advancedcases there is marked destruction of the parenchyma causing 'honeycombing' (due to groups of closely set ring shadows), andnodular shadows are not conspicuous. The mediastinum may appear broad as a result of a decrease in lung volume.·       Blood gases: arterial desaturation worsens while upright and improves on recum-bency. There is arterial hypoxaemia and hypocapnia.·       Pulmonary function tests: in the early stages lung volumes may be normal, but there is arterial desaturation following exercise.Typically there is a restrictive defect with reduction of both the gas transfer factor and gas transfer coefficient.·       High ESR; raised immunoglobulins; raised antinuclear factor; rheumatoid factoris positive.·       Bronchial lavage: a large number of lymphocytes indicates a good response to steroids and a good prognosis. A large numberof neutrophils and eosinophils indi-cates a poor prognosis (5-year survival rate of 60% for steroid responders versus 25% fornon-responders). The patients are more likely to respond to cyclophos-phamide if the number of neutrophils is increased (AmRev Respir Dis 1987; 135: 26).·       Lung biopsy: in early stages there is mononuclear cell infiltration in the alveolar walls, progressing to interstitial fibrosis - knownas usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP); in later stages fibrotic contraction of the lung, honeycombing, bronchial dilatation andcysts are seen. DIP - alveolar macrophages with little mononuclear infiltration or fibrosis - has a better prognosis than UIP as itresponds to steroids.·       MRI is useful in determining disease activity without ionizing radiation but it isan expensive method. · High-resolution CT (HRCT) is useful to assess the pattern and extent of disease. Patients with a predominantly ground-glassappearance are treated whereas those with a predominantly reticular appearance undergo technetium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate scanning (DPTA) to assess the probability of deterioration. HRCT may avoid the need for biopsy, especially ifthere is predominantly reticular shadowing. It acts as a guide for ideal biopsy site.·       Technetium-99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DPTA) scanning in non-smokers is of value in identifying which patients aremore likely to deteriorate.

Aspiration is less painful than intercostal drainage, leads to a shorter admission and reduces theneed for pleurectomy with no increase in recurrence rate at 1 year.·       When there is rapid re-expansion following simple aspiration, an intercostal tube with underwater seal drainage is used. Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered.

       "  'ans': '·    Firstly, since radioiodine treatment carries a substantial risk of exacerbatingpre-existing thyroid eye disease, it should be avoided as far as possible in patientswith active or severe ophthalmopathy, in whom medical therapy with a thionamidedrug such as carbimazole is preferable. Radioiodine may be used in patients withmild eye disease but adjuvant oral corticosteriods should be prescribed (N Engl JMed 1998; 338: 73-8).·    Secondly, patients without clinical evidence of thyroid disease have a small risk ofdeveloping ophthalmopathy and a very low risk of developing severe eye disease.It is prudent to warn all patients of this complication, but the risks do not justifydenying most patients the benefits of definitive treatment with radioiodine whenindicated. In addition, the risks do not justify the routine use of corti-costeroids inpatients without ophthalmopathy (BMJ 1999; 319: 68-9).·    Thirdly, smoking, a raised serum triiodothyronine concentration, and uncorrectedhypothyroidism are also factors which can exacerbate thyroid eye disease.There-fore, to reduce the risk of thyroid eye disease, patients should beencouraged to stop smoking, be rendered euthyroid with a thionamide beforeradioiodine, and be monitored closely to detect and treat early hypothyroidism orpersistent hyperthyroidism.\\n'},\n",

On recovery from the illness, the indices of thyroid function return to normal (N Engl J Med 1995; 333: 1562-3). The changes in thyroidal indices include: · Decrease in extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine T4 to triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of the thyroid hormone. A decrease in thyrotrophin secretion, which causes decreased thyroidal secretion and, in time, decreases in serum T4 concentrations and further decreases in serum T3 concentrations - the latter due to both decreased secretion of T3 by the thyroid and diminished availability of T4 for peripheral conversion to T3. Decreased production or diminished affinity for thyroidal hormones of one or more major serum thyroid hormone-binding proteins - thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin and albumin. These decreases can result in decreased serum total thyroxine levels but not in free T4 or T3. Serum concentrations of reverse T3 (which is inactive) are increased because its deiodination is impaired. \\n'},\n",

       " {'med_hist': \" INSTRUCTION Examine this patient. Look at this patient's face. SALIENT FEATURES History · History of steroid therapy. · Central weight gain. · Hirsutism (see pp 428-31). · Easy braising. · Acne. · Weakness of muscle. · Menstrual disturbance. · Loss of libido. · Depression, sleep disturbances. · Back pain due to spinal osteoporosis. Examination Moon-like facies (Fig. 3), acne, hirsutism and plethora (due to telangiectasia). Proceed as follows: · Examine the following: -The mouth for superimposed thrush. -The interscapular area for 'buffalo hump'. -Increased fat pads and bulge above supraclavicular fossae (more specific for Cushing's syndrome). -The abdomen for thinning of skin and purple striae (also seen over the shoulders and thighs) - said to be present on almost all patients (Fig. 4). -The limbs for bruising, wasting of the limbs, weakness of the muscles of the shoulders and hips - get the patient to squat (proximal myopathy). -Ask the patient whether she has back pain and then examine the spine, looking for evidence of osteoporosis and collapse of vertebra, kyphoscoliosis. -Measure the blood pressure. · Tell the examiner you would like to: -Test the urine for glucose. -Check visual fields (for pituitary tumour). -Examine the fundus for optic atrophy, papilloedema, signs of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy. Note. Hirsutism is not common in Cushing's syndrome caused by exogenous steroids because they suppress adrenal androgen secretion. Also comment on signs of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, fibrosing alveolitis (as these are conditions that are treated with long-term steroids).

       "  'ans': \"It is a syndrome that occurs after bilateral adrenalectomy and is characterized by arapidly growing pituitary adenoma, very high ACTH levels and hyperpigmentation.As the incidence may be as high as 50%, patients with Cushing's disease whohave undergone adrenalectomy should be followed by regular plasma ACTH levelsand imaging for pituitary tumours.Harvey Williams Cushing (1869-1939) was Professor of Surgery at Harvard. He wasawardedthe Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Osier (Cushing H 1932 Thebasophil adenomas of the pituitary body and their clinical manifestation.
