  RESPIRATORY DISEASES   APPROACH TO THE PATIENT A productive cough is a feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis (large volumes). Yellow sputum does not always indicate infection, as eosinophils in the sputum can give the same appearance, e.g. in asthma. Green sputum usually implies infection. Haemoptysis (blood-stained sputum) varies from small streaks of blood to massive bleeding. • Mild haemoptysis is usually caused by an acute infection, e.g. exacerbations of COPD, but it should not be attributed to this without investigation. • Other common causes are pulmonary infarction, bronchial carcinoma and TB. • In lobar pneumonia, the sputum is usually rusty in appearance rather than frankly blood-stained. • Pink, frothy sputum is seen in pulmonary oedema. • In bronchiectasis, the blood is often mixed with purulent sputum. • Massive haemoptyses (> 200 mL of blood in 24 hours) are usually due to bronchiectasis or TB. Haemoptysis should always be investigated. Often, the diagnosis can be made from a CXR, but a normal CXR does not exclude disease. Bronchos- copy is only diagnostic in about 5% of patients with haemoptysis and a normal CXR. For management of a massive haemoptysis, see Box 13.1. Treatment of cough is the treatment of the underlying cause and often symptomatic. Anti-tussives include codeine linctus 5–10 mL 3–4 times daily or pholcodine 5 mL 3–4 times daily. There is no evidence that expec- torants work but simple linctus 5 mL 3–4 times daily is comforting. Shortness of breath Most people get breathless on exertion; exercise tolerance should be docu- mented. Breathlessness can be of sudden onset, e.g. in acute left ventricular failure, or more progressive, as in COPD. It may vary at different times of the day, e.g. in asthma it is usually worse in the morning. Breathlessness on lying flat occurs in, for example, pulmonary oedema (p. 425). Breathlessness with a wheeze occurring on exposure to an allergen is seen in asthma (e.g. horse riding). It can occur many hours after exposure to an allergen (p. 520) in, for example, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Inhalation of foreign bodies can cause choking and acute shortage of breath. Treatment is with the Heimlich manoeuvre. See Emergencies in Medicine p. 714. Chest pain Chest pain in respiratory disease is usually pleuritic. Pain can be due to other causes, e.g. localized pain in costochondritis. Shoulder tip pain sug- gests irritation of the diaphragmatic pleura. Retrosterna
