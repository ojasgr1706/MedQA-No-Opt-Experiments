Thus, myasthenia\\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio.

A shunt occurs when deoxygenated blood is transported to the\\nleft heart and systemic circulation without having the capability of becoming oxygenated. Causes\\nof shunt include alveolar collapse (atelectasis), intra-alveolar filling processes, intrapulmonary\\nvascular malformations, or structural cardiac disease leading to right-to-left shunt.

Thus, myasthenia\\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio.
