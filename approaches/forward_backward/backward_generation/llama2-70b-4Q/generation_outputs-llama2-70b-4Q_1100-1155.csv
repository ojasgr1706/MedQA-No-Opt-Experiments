"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?
(A) Hepatotoxicity (B) Lipodystrophy (C) Myelosuppression (D) Peripheral neuropathy

The patient has developed a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, and the decision has been made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of HIV. It has several potential adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. However, the patient is at greatest risk for myelosuppression as a result of this change in medication regimen. Ritonavir can cause a dose-dependent decrease in white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. This is because ritonavir inhibits the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are responsible for the metabolism of many medications, including antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, the answer is (C).",C,B

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. The patient has multiple ulcers on her oropharynx. The patient's laboratory results show a low platelet count, low white blood cell count, and low hemoglobin. The patient's behavior is consistent with possible psychosis. The patient's low platelet count, low white blood cell count, and low hemoglobin are consistent with a possible autoimmune disorder. The patient's history of depression and anxiety suggests a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The answer is (D).",D,D
"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain is through the cisterna chyli. The cisterna chyli is a collection of lymph nodes located along the thoracic inlet and receives lymph from the lower abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes. From the cisterna chyli, the lymph flows into the thoracic duct, which empties into the left subclavian vein. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

Q: A 67-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided chest pain and difficulty speaking. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and temperature is 37.2°C (99°F). There is no evidence of a focal neurological deficit. An urgent computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain shows a large left-sided intracerebral hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) intravenously (B) Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) intra-arterially (C) Perform emergency surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage (D) Observe the patient closely with serial neurological examinations and CT scans
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. She presents with sudden onset of left-sided chest pain and difficulty speaking. The urgent computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain shows a large left-sided intracerebral hemorrhage. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) intravenously. tPA works by breaking down blood clots and can help to improve blood flow to the affected area of the brain. However, it must be administered within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms to be effective. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 36-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden-onset severe headache, confusion, and left hemiparesis. She is currently 20 weeks pregnant. She is awake but unable to speak or move the left side of her body. Her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and her pulse is 120/min. She has no history of previous neurological disease or recent travel. She is currently taking prenatal vitamins and no other medications. She has no allergies. Her physical examination shows aphasia, left hemiparesis, and left facial weakness/paralysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Ischemic stroke (B) Hemorrhagic stroke (C) Cerebral vasculitis (D) Preeclampsia
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden-onset severe headache, confusion, and left hemiparesis, which could be due to a neurological disorder. She is currently 20 weeks pregnant, which increases the likelihood of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can occur during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver. The patient's blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, which is consistent with preeclampsia. The patient's symptoms are likely due to preeclampsia. The answer is (D).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of worsening fatigue, weight loss, and cold intolerance. She also has had increasing difficulty walking because of weakness in her legs. She has been taking levothyroxine sodium (T4) 100 mcg daily for the past 3 years for hypothyroidism. She appears thin and has a thin, pale skin, and a slow speech. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 56/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a flat affect, slow movements, and proximal muscle weakness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a T4 level of 120 ng/dL (N = 50–120) and a T3 level of 40 ng/dL (N = 80–200). The test for antithyroid antibodies is positive. The test for antithyroglobulin antibodies is negative. A thyroid ultrasound shows a heterogeneous thyroid gland with several nodules. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Start levothyroxine sodium 200 mcg daily (B) Start liothyronine sodium 5 mcg daily (C) Start methimazole 10 mg daily (D) Perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of taking levothyroxine sodium 100 mcg daily for the past 3 years for hypothyroidism. She has a flat affect, slow movements, and proximal muscle weakness, which could be caused by hypothyroidism. Her T4 level is 120 ng/dL, which is within the normal range, but her T3 level is 40 ng/dL, which is low. The patient has positive antithyroid antibodies, which could indicate autoimmune thyroiditis. The patient also has a heterogeneous thyroid gland with several nodules, which could indicate thyroid cancer. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start levothyroxine sodium 200 mcg daily, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with hypothyroidism, and her T3 level is low. The answer is (A).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

The mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge, but the neonate has been feeding and voiding well. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and her partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate's biological father is no longer involved in the patient's care, but her mother's boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. The patient's temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. The patient has a normal vaginal exam. The most likely diagnosis is a normal variant of vaginal discharge in a neonate. The discharge is likely due to the maternal hormones still present in the neonate's system. The discharge should resolve on its own within a few days. The answer is (D).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 27-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. She is unable to move her left arm or leg and has difficulty articulating words. She is afebrile and her vital signs are otherwise normal. Physical examination shows a left hemiparesis and dysarthria. A non-contrast head CT scan shows a left posterior frontal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (B) Perform an urgent cerebral angiography (C) Administer intravenous corticosteroids (D) Observe the patient closely and consider rehabilitation therapy after 48 hours
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking, consistent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The non-contrast head CT scan confirms this diagnosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage is caused by bleeding within the brain tissue. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the patient. tPA works by breaking down blood clots, which can help to improve blood flow to the affected area and reduce the risk of further damage. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?
(A) Increased creatine kinase concentration (B) Decreased glucose concentration (C) Increased triglyceride concentration (D) Increased bradykinin concentration
A: Let's think step by step.",Q: A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?,(A) Increased creatine kinase concentration (B) Decreased glucose concentration (C) Increased triglyceride concentration (D) Increased bradykinin concentration,"The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily. The physician has prescribed a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. This medication is likely a statin, which is commonly used to treat high cholesterol. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the mevalonate pathway. This pathway is also involved in the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for the production of cholesterol and other lipids. However, the mevalonate pathway is also involved in the synthesis of other compounds, such as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and dolichol, which are important for energy production and cell signaling. As a result, statins can cause a variety of adverse effects, including muscle pain and weakness, liver damage, and increased risk of diabetes. One potential adverse effect of statins is an increase in creatine kinase concentration. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a role in energy production in muscles. When muscles are damaged, creatine kinase is released into the bloodstream, leading to an increase in serum concentration. This increase can be used as a marker of muscle damage. Therefore, the answer is (A).

Q: A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of sudden hearing loss in his right ear and a severe headache. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He is currently taking amlodipine and atorvastatin. He has no history of ear problems or previous episodes of sudden hearing loss. Physical examination shows a Weber Class III/IV systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Audiometry shows a profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administration of intravenous furosemide (B) Referral to otolaryngology for further evaluation (C) Administration of intravenous glucocorticoids (D) Administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden hearing loss in his right ear and a severe headache. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He is currently taking amlodipine and atorvastatin. He has no history of ear problems or previous episodes of sudden hearing loss. Physical examination shows a Weber Class III/IV systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Audiometry shows a profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). The next step in management would be to refer the patient to otolaryngology for further evaluation. This is because SSNHL is a medical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to minimize the risk of permanent hearing loss. The otolaryngologist will perform a thorough evaluation, including a detailed history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies and audiometric tests, to determine the underlying cause of the hearing loss and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",(A) Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells (B) Dilation of efferent arteriole (C) Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa (D) Decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at proximal tubule,"The patient has hypertension and coronary artery disease. His blood pressure has been consistently high over the past 4 months, despite being on medication. He was started on amlodipine 3 weeks ago, but his blood pressure today is still high at 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, which is likely to cause decreased renal blood flow. Decreased renal blood flow would lead to decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa, which in turn would cause decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at the proximal tubule. The answer is (C).

Q: A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue, fever, and weight loss. She also describes a 2-week history of productive cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. She has a 2-year history of hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril. She appears thin and has a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse of 102/min, respirations of 24/min, and blood pressure of 128/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows rales at the right lung base and a grade III/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. A chest x-ray shows a dense infiltrate in the right mid-lung field. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Sputum Gram stain and culture (B) Blood cultures (C) Bronchoscopy (D) Non-contrast CT scan of the chest
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has symptoms of productive cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. These symptoms could be caused by a lung infection, such as pneumonia. The patient also has a fever and weight loss, which could be caused by an underlying infection. The chest x-ray shows a dense infiltrate in the right mid-lung field, which is consistent with pneumonia. The patient's history of hypertension and current medication, lisinopril, suggest that the patient has underlying lung disease. The most appropriate next step in management would be to order a non-contrast CT scan of the chest to further evaluate the lung infiltrate and determine the extent of lung disease. The answer is (D).

A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?

Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?",(A) Left circumflex (B) Diagonal perforators (C) Septal perforators (D) Right main,"The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. This suggests that the infarction is likely caused by a blockage in one of the coronary arteries that supplies the posterior wall of the heart. The most likely occluded coronary artery is the (C) Septal perforators. This is because the septal perforators arise from the proximal part of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and supply the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The other options do not supply the posterior wall of the heart. The answer is (C).

Q: A 27-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden onset of severe left knee pain after a twisting injury while playing soccer. She has no history of previous knee injuries or surgery. On physical examination, she has marked tenderness to palpation over the medial femoral condyle, and her knee is swollen and warm to the touch. There is no erythema or visible deformity. She has full range of motion, but is unable to bear weight. Plain radiographs show a displacement of the medial femoral condyle, with the articular surface being pushed medially and superiorly. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Arthrocentesis (B) Immobilization with a hinged brace (C) Closed reduction with manipulation (D) Open reduction with internal fixation
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden onset of severe left knee pain after a twisting injury while playing soccer. She has marked tenderness to palpation over the medial femoral condyle, and her knee is swollen and warm to the touch. There is no erythema or visible deformity. She has full range of motion, but is unable to bear weight. Plain radiographs show a displacement of the medial femoral condyle, with the articular surface being pushed medially and superiorly. This is consistent with a medial tibial plateau fracture. The most appropriate next step in management is (C) Closed reduction with manipulation. This is because closed reduction with manipulation is a minimally invasive procedure that can effectively realign the bones and restore the normal anatomy of the knee joint. Arthrocentesis (option A) may be needed to relieve knee swelling and pain, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Immobilization with a hinged brace (option B) may be needed to stabilize the knee after reduction, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Open reduction with internal fixation (option D) may be needed if the fracture is displaced and cannot be reduced closed, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management given the displacement of the medial femoral condyle. The answer is (C).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months.

Laboratory studies show: Alkaline phosphatase 925 U/L, Serum calcium 9.2 mg/dL, Serum phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL. The bone biopsy shows a tumor with a distinctive ""salt and pepper"" appearance. The most likely diagnosis is Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC). It is a rare benign bone tumor that is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on X-rays. The age of the patient and the fact that he has symptoms make it less likely that the diagnosis is Ewing's sarcoma. The patient's age and the absence of other signs of osteitis deformans (such as bowing of the long bones) make it less likely that the diagnosis is osteitis deformans. Osteochondritis dissecans is a condition where a piece of cartilage and bone in a joint becomes detached, causing pain and swelling. It is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the absence of a history of trauma. The answer is (D).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

The answer is (A).

Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of a 2-day history of worsening left knee pain. She has no history of knee injuries. She has been doing aerobic dancing for 2 months. She is currently taking no medications. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild swelling of the left knee. The knee is tender to palpation over the medial tibial condyle. The patient has a limited range of motion in the knee, and there is no erythema or warmth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Osteoarthritis (B) Meniscal tear (C) Medial tibial stress syndrome (D) Patellofemoral pain syndrome
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has worsening left knee pain, mild swelling of the left knee, tenderness to palpation over the medial tibial condyle, and a limited range of motion in the knee. These symptoms are consistent with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints. MTSS is a common condition in runners and is caused by repetitive trauma to the medial tibial condyle. The patient's history of recent initiation of aerobic dancing and lack of knee injuries supports this diagnosis. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Acute stress disorder (B) Performance anxiety (C) Posttraumatic stress disorder (D) Panic attack

He has an intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He has had to take a leave from his army instructor duties because of this. Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Acute stress disorder is a possibility, but given the patient's history and duration of symptoms, PTSD is a more likely diagnosis. Performance anxiety is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not related to performance or evaluation. Panic attack is also not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with panic attacks. The answer is (C).

Q: A 55-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of worsening left knee pain. She has no history of knee injuries. She is currently taking aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Physical examination shows swelling and warmth of the left knee. There is moderate tenderness to palpation over the knee joint. The patient is able to fully extend the knee but has limited flexion. There is no erythema or purulent drainage. The patient's temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Order radiographs of the knee (B) Administer intravenous antibiotics (C) Order an ultrasound of the knee (D) Administer intravenous analgesia
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a 3-day history of worsening left knee pain, swelling, and warmth. There is moderate tenderness to palpation over the knee joint, and the patient is able to fully extend the knee but has limited flexion. These symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a knee effusion. The patient has a history of gout, which could be causing the effusion. However, given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is also possible that the effusion is caused by another condition such as an infection or injury. The most appropriate next step in management would be to order radiographs of the knee to evaluate for any bone abnormalities or foreign bodies that may be causing the effusion. Administering intravenous antibiotics or analgesia may be appropriate depending on the cause of the effusion, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. An ultrasound of the knee may also be useful in evaluating the effusion, but it is not as urgent as radiographs. The answer is (A).

A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?",(A) Major Basic Protein (B) Mucus (C) Surfactant (D) Elastase,"The patient has a1-antitrypsin deficiency. This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a protein that protects the lungs from damage caused by proteolytic enzymes. The lack of AAT in the lungs makes them more susceptible to proteolytic damage, which can lead to lung tissue destruction and emphysema. The patient's symptoms, such as increasing dyspnea, are consistent with this condition. The factor responsible for the patient's condition is elastase, which is released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Elastase is a proteolytic enzyme that can break down elastin, a protein found in lung tissue. The lack of AAT in the lungs makes them more susceptible to elastase damage, leading to lung tissue destruction and emphysema. The answer is (D).

The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago. His only medication is metformin. His serum glucose is 186 mg/dL and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. The physician prescribes an additional antidiabetic drug and counsels the patient on its delayed onset of action. At a follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, the patient reports that his home blood glucose readings have improved. He also mentions that he has had a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb). The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?
(A) Empagliflozin (B) Liraglutide (C) Rosiglitazone (D) Glyburide
A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago.

The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?",(A) Empagliflozin (B) Liraglutide (C) Rosiglitazone (D) Glyburide,"The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is currently taking metformin. The physician has prescribed an additional antidiabetic drug, and the patient has reported improved home blood glucose readings. The patient has also gained 4 kg (8.8 lb) in weight. This suggests that the patient has been treated with a drug that promotes weight gain, such as rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone is an insulin sensitizer that increases glucose uptake in the body and promotes weight gain as a side effect. The answer is (C).

Q: A 58-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 3-hour history of sudden-onset, severe, substernal pain that radiates to her left arm. She also has a feeling of impending doom, shortness of breath, and a cold sweat. She has no history of cardiac disease. Her blood pressure is 188/108 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and temperature is 37.2°C (99°F). Physical examination shows jugular venous distension, a regular cardiac rhythm, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Electrocardiography shows ST elevation in leads V3-V6. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer aspirin (B) Administer clopidogrel (C) Administer heparin (D) Perform coronary angiography
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden-onset, severe, substernal pain that radiates to her left arm, a feeling of impending doom, shortness of breath, and a cold sweat. These are symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and physical examination shows jugular venous distension and a regular cardiac rhythm. Electrocardiography shows ST elevation in leads V3-V6. This suggests that the patient is having a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The most appropriate next step in management is to administer aspirin. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that helps to prevent platelet aggregation and can help to reduce the risk of further cardiac damage in patients with ACS. The answer is (A).

Q: A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, and a productive cough that produces yellow sputum. She has had night sweats, malaise, and arthralgia. She has no significant medical history. Her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate respiratory distress, bilateral crackles, and wheezes. A chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe infiltrate. White blood cell count is 18,000/mm3, with 70% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Pneumocystis pneumonia (B) Community-acquired pneumonia (C) Tuberculosis (D) Bronchitis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a fever, chills, productive cough that produces yellow sputum, night sweats, malaise, and arthralgia. These are symptoms of pneumonia. The chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe infiltrate. The white blood cell count is 18,000/mm3, with 70% polymorphonuclear neutrophils, which is consistent with pneumonia. The most likely diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP is a common complication of respiratory infections and can be caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The answer is (B).

Q: A 27-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of worsening left knee pain. He has no history of knee injuries. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.0°C (",C,C
