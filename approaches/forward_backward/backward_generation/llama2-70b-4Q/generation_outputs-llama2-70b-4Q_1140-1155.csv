"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?
(A) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (B) In-patient psychiatric therapy (C) Antidepressants (D) Appetite stimulants

His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?
(A) Can form an endospore (B) Has no cell wall (C) Is more common in parrot owners (D) Is transmitted by air conditioning

The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?",(A) Can form an endospore (B) Has no cell wall (C) Is more common in parrot owners (D) Is transmitted by air conditioning,"The patient has a fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He recently traveled and engaged in various activities, including kayaking and visiting spas. He also ate local foods and interacted with local animals. The patient's symptoms and recent travel suggest the possibility of a respiratory infection. The patient's smoking history and recent exposure to animals also increase the likelihood of a respiratory infection. The patient's chest examination reveals fine crackles on auscultation, and the chest radiograph shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. The patient's labs show mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. Given the patient's symptoms and recent activities, the organism most likely responsible for his symptoms is Legionella pneumophila, which is a bacterium that can cause Legionnaires' disease. Legionella pneumophila is not transmitted by air conditioning, and it does not have a cell wall. It can, however, form an endospore, which allows it to survive in adverse environmental conditions. The answer is (A).

Q: A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of sudden severe pain in the scrotum, which started 30 minutes ago. The pain is not relieved by lying still or changing positions. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a swollen, tender, and red scrotum. There is no evidence of trauma. The patient has a history of unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days ago. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer ceftriaxone and metronidazole (B) Perform a scrotal ultrasound (C) Perform a scrotal exploration (D) Administer doxycycline
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden severe pain in the scrotum, which started 30 minutes ago. The pain is not relieved by lying still or changing positions. The patient has a history of unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days ago. The patient's symptoms and history suggest the possibility of epididymitis or orchitis. Epididymitis is an infection of the epididymis, which is a tube that runs along the back of the testicle and stores sperm. Orchitis is an infection of the testicle. Both epididymitis and orchitis can cause scrotal pain and swelling. The patient's afebrile status and normal vital signs suggest that the infection is likely not severe. The patient's history of unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days ago increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most appropriate next step in management is to administer ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Ceftriaxone is effective against many bacterial pathogens that cause epididymitis and orchitis, including Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which are common causes of STIs. Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria, which can also cause epididymitis and orchitis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of worsening right knee pain that has limited her mobility. She has no history of knee trauma or previous knee surgery. She appears to be in moderate distress. The temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 140/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild swelling of the right knee, moderate tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the knee, and a moderate effusion. There is no warmth or erythema of the overlying skin. The patient walks with a cane and has a limping gait. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Order an urgent MRI of the knee (B) Administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (C) Perform an arthrocentesis (D) Order an urgent radiograph of the knee
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a",A,D

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother’s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?
(A) Botox (B) Carbamazepine (C) Methylprednisolone (D) Ceftriaxone

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?
(A) Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption. (B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products. (C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder. (D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.

(B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products. (C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder. (D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.,"The patient has a history of smoking, gastrointestinal reflux disease, and head trauma with two seizure episodes. He has tried different nicotine replacement products without success. He heard that an antidepressant can help with smoking cessation and asks his physician for advice. The medication the patient is referring to is bupropion. Bupropion is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that can help with smoking cessation. It is not metabolized by the liver and therefore does not interact with omeprazole. Bupropion is not only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products. It can be used alone or in combination with nicotine replacement products. Bupropion can lower the seizure threshold and therefore should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder. The patient's history of seizure disorder is a relative contraindication for the use of bupropion. The physician may consider other options for smoking cessation, such as varenicline, which does not lower the seizure threshold. The answer is (C).

Q: A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia is evaluated for a 2-day history of worsening substernal pain. He has a history of similar symptoms 6 months ago that resolved with antacids. He has been taking antacids regularly since then. He appears uncomfortable. His vital signs are within normal limits. There is no evidence of ischemia on the electrocardiogram. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform esophageal manometry (B) Perform upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (C) Administer intravenous proton pump inhibitor (D) Administer intravenous nitroglycerin

The answer is (B).

Q: A 65-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and hypertension presents to the emergency department because of sudden onset left-sided chest pain. The pain is described as a crushing sensation that radiates to her left arm. She is diaphoretic and has a look of acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 110/min. The patient appears to be in acute respiratory distress. The most likely diagnosis is:
(A) Pulmonary embolism (B) Myocardial infarction (C) Pneumothorax (D) Rib fracture
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of osteoporosis and hypertension. She presents with sudden onset left-sided chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She is diaphoretic and has a look of acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 110/min. The patient appears to be in acute respiratory distress. The most likely diagnosis is myocardial infarction. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath are consistent with myocardial infarction. The patient's history of hypertension increases her risk for cardiovascular disease. The patient's age also increases her risk for cardiovascular disease. Pulmonary embolism is less likely given the patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Pneumothorax and rib fracture are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. The answer is (B).

A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?
(A) 67% (B) 100% (C) 75% (D) 50%
A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception.

This could be due to phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder. If the patient is a carrier of PKU, there is a 50% chance that she will pass the mutated gene to each of her children. Since the patient has no similar symptoms, it is likely that she is a carrier of PKU. The most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is a blood test to measure her PAH enzyme activity. The answer is (D).

Q: A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden onset of severe left lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 2 hours. She is currently at 24 weeks of gestation. She is afebrile, and her blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows moderate tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. The patient appears uncomfortable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer oxygen (B) Administer intravenous fluids (C) Obtain a stat ultrasound of the abdomen (D) Perform a stat laparoscopy
A: Let's think step by step. The patient is 24 weeks pregnant and has sudden severe left lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. This could be due to acute appendicitis. The patient's afebrile and normal blood pressure support the diagnosis. The patient appears uncomfortable, and abdominal examination shows moderate tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a stat ultrasound of the abdomen. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and rule out other possible causes of abdominal pain in pregnancy, such as a placental abruption or preterm labor. The answer is (C).
