"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states she has pain in the right side of her abdomen which started yesterday and has been worsening.

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",(A) Korsakoff syndrome (B) Methanol poisoning (C) Cerebellar degeneration (D) Wernicke's encephalopathy,"The patient has a history of multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. He works in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He drinks one pint of rum daily. The patient is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are within normal limits. Examination shows a wide-based gait, a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a neurological disorder. The patient's history of alcohol consumption and exposure to industrial solvents suggests that the cause of his condition may be related to these factors. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a neurological disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Wernicke's encephalopathy is often associated with chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. The patient's exposure to industrial solvents may also have contributed to his condition, as solvents can interfere with thiamine absorption. The answer is (D).

He appears anxious and diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a regular rhythm, no murmurs, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolus. An ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVf. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous furosemide (B) Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (C) Administer intravenous heparin (D) Perform an exercise stress test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and smoking. He appears anxious and diaphoretic. His temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a regular rhythm, no murmurs, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolus. An ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVf. The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer sublingual nitroglycerin, which is a medication used to treat angina and coronary artery disease. Nitroglycerin works by releasing nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that can reduce the pressure gradient across the coronary arteries and increase blood flow to the myocardium. The answer is (B).

Q: A 50-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe headache, blurred vision, and weakness of the right arm and leg.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after 3 days of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?
(A) Sulfosalicylic acid test (B) Urine sodium content (C) Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) (D) Nitrates in urine

Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?",(A) Sulfosalicylic acid test (B) Urine sodium content (C) Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) (D) Nitrates in urine,"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and hypertension. He presents with shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. He has a low blood pressure, an elevated serum creatinine, and signs of congestive heart failure. The patient has a high probability of prerenal azotemia. Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in renal blood flow, which can be caused by congestive heart failure. Intrinsic kidney disease is less likely given the patient's history and presentation. The patient has not had a significant change in his urine output or proteinuria. The most useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease would be the fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea). FEUrea is a measure of the percentage of urea that is excreted in the urine. In prerenal azotemia, the FEUrea is typically low because the kidneys are not able to concentrate the urine properly due to decreased renal blood flow. In intrinsic kidney disease, the FEUrea is typically high because the kidneys are not able to reabsorb urea properly due to tubular damage. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well.

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL
Hematocrit 43.2 %
White blood cells 14,500 /mm3
Platelets 312,000/mm3
Neutrophil 81.6%
Lymphocyte 15.2%

(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?
(A) Alkaline phosphatase (B) Creatine kinase (CK-MB) (C) Lactate dehydrogenase (D) Troponin T

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Hypertensive retinopathy (B) Diabetic retinopathy (C) Central retinal vein occlusion (D) Central retinal artery occlusion
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She has been experiencing intermittent blurring of vision in both eyes over the past 2 months. She has also been experiencing unilateral headaches. The patient has sudden loss of vision in her right eye. The physical examination shows normal visual acuity in the left eye and no light perception in the right eye. There is a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. The most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion. This is supported by the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the sudden loss of vision in one eye, and the physical examination findings of no light perception in the right eye and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. The answer is (D).

Q: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of worsening headache, fever, and nausea. She has been vomiting once or twice a day. She has not had any recent travel or contact with sick people. She has no significant medical history. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 12,000/mm3, with 80% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Blood cultures are drawn. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer ceftriaxone and metronidazole (B) Administer vancomycin (C) Administer acyclovir (D) Administer ampicillin and gentamicin
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. She has a leukocytosis with 80% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the complete blood count results, support this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to administer ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against common causes of bacterial meningitis, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Metronidazole is an imidazole antibiotic that is effective against anaerobic bacteria and is used to treat bacterial meningitis caused by Bacteroides species. The answer is (A).

""","The patient has left wrist pain and swelling after falling on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a wrist sprain. Finkelstein's test is negative, which suggests that the patient does not have a scaphoid fracture. X-rays of the wrist show no abnormalities. The patient's age and mechanism of injury suggest that a sprain is more likely than a fracture. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks would be appropriate to immobilize the wrist and allow for healing. Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks would also be appropriate to allow for healing and to monitor for any changes. Corticosteroid injections would not be appropriate as they would not promote healing and could potentially worsen the injury. Percutaneous pinning would also not be appropriate as it is not necessary for a sprain. The answer is (B).

Q: A 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department because of sudden onset of severe substernal pain that radiates to the left arm and jaw.

The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace.

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension.

He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?
(A) Alpha-adrenergic antagonism (B) Beta-adrenergic antagonism (C) Relative lipophobicity (D) Serotonergic antagonism

What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",(A) Alpha-adrenergic antagonism (B) Beta-adrenergic antagonism (C) Relative lipophobicity (D) Serotonergic antagonism,"Fexofenadine is an antihistamine that is less sedating than diphenhydramine. This is because fexofenadine has a relatively lipophobic property, which means it is less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation. Fexofenadine has a higher pKa, which makes it more ionized at physiologic pH, rendering it less capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Diphenhydramine, on the other hand, has a lower pKa, which makes it more lipid-soluble and capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, leading to sedation. The answer is (C).

Q: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of fever and a rash. The rash began on his face and has spread to his trunk and limbs over the past 2 days. He has been afebrile until today, when his temperature rose to 102.2°F (39°C). He is currently taking no medications. He has no known allergies. He appears ill and has a moderate respiratory distress. His pulse oximetry on room air shows 92% saturation. His blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a diffuse, macular, confluent rash on his face, trunk, and extremities. There are no petechiae, purpura, or signs of meningism. A viral culture and PCR for herpes simplex virus are ordered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer acyclovir (B) Administer amoxicillin (C) Administer ceftriaxone and metronidazole (D) Administer azithromycin
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a fever and a rash that has spread from his face to his trunk and limbs over the past 2 days. He appears ill and has moderate respiratory distress. His blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a viral exanthemata, such as roseola, fifth disease, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex virus, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The answer is (A).

Q: A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of worsening left knee pain. He has no history of knee injuries. He has been taking ibuprofen as needed for the past week. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows swelling over the left knee. There is moderate tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the knee. There is no erythema or warmth. The patient can walk without assistance. A radiograph of the knee shows a 1-cm displacement of the medial tibial plateau. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Arthrocentesis (B) MRI of the knee (C) Knee immobilization with a hinged brace (D) Intra-articular corticosteroid injection
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has worsening left knee pain, swelling over the left knee, and moderate tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the knee. These symptoms are consistent with a medial tibial plateau fracture. The patient can walk without assistance, which suggests that the fracture is likely stable. The most appropriate next step in management would be to immobilize the knee with a hinged brace to allow the fracture to heal. Arthrocentesis (option A) may be used to aspirate blood or joint fluid, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. MRI of the knee (option B) may be used to further evaluate the extent of the fracture, but it is not necessary at this time. Intra-articular",C,C

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
(A) Asbestos inhalation (B) Neoplastic transformation (C) Opportunistic colonization (D) Abscess formation

The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. The patient's symptoms are consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is needed to break down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods. Without this enzyme, phenylalanine builds up in the blood and brain, leading to intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral problems. The best way to prevent PKU is to restrict phenylalanine in the diet. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

(D) A type 1 error has been made.,"The researcher has conducted a study to determine if low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He has used a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. This means that there is a 5% chance that the observed association between low birth weight and obesity is due to chance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, and it suggests that low birth weight is associated with obesity. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected, so a type 1 error has been made. The answer is (D).

The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
(A) CT scan of the abdomen (B) Transabdominal ultrasonography (C) Anorectal manometry (D) Rectal suction biopsy

An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. The most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder that affects the large intestine. It is characterized by a lack of ganglion cells in the distal portion of the colon, which leads to constipation and abdominal distension. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings support this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis using a test that can visualize the colon and show the absence of ganglion cells. The answer is (B).

Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",(A) Polyhydramnios (B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (C) Meconium aspiration (D) Placental abruption,"The patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which puts the child at risk for complications related to prolonged gestation. The patient's history of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively, suggests that she may have a history of prolonged labor. The patient's current pregnancy has been uncomplicated, which suggests that the risk of acute complications such as placental abruption or acute respiratory distress syndrome is low. The patient's BMI of 33 kg/m2 suggests that she may be at increased risk for gestational diabetes, but this is not a direct risk factor for the child. The patient's nontender, soft uterus suggests that the risk of uterine rupture is low. The child is at greatest risk for (C) meconium aspiration. Meconium aspiration occurs when the fetus inhales a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid during delivery, which can cause respiratory distress. The risk of meconium aspiration increases with prolonged gestation, as the fetus may pass meconium in utero. The answer is (C).

Vitals include a pulse of 64/min, a respiratory rate of 7/min, and a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, the patient is unresponsive to voice and touch but shows a flexor response to pain. Her breathing is shallow. The pupils are constricted, and a response to light cannot be determined. An arterial blood gas sample reveals:
pH 7.26
Pco2 70 mm Hg
HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?",(A) Diabetic ketoacidosis (B) Diuretic overdose (C) Hyperventilation (D) Opioid overdose,"The patient is unconscious, has a slow respiratory rate, and shallow breathing. The arterial blood gas sample shows a Pco2 of 70 mm Hg, which is very high. This could indicate hyperventilation. The patient's presentation could be explained by hyperventilation, which is a common complication of diabetic ketoacidosis. The answer is (C).

Q: A 27-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of amenorrhea. She denies any recent illnesses, medication use, or changes in her diet. She has not had any recent vaginal bleeding or spotting. She has been sexually active with her boyfriend, using no form of contraception. Her last menstrual period was 6 months ago. She has been trying to conceive for the past 3 months. Physical examination shows a blood pressure of 118/76 mm Hg, a pulse of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 18/min. The patient's body mass index is 24 kg/m2. Examination of the breasts, abdomen, and pelvis shows no abnormalities. A vaginal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries. The patient's serum follicle-stimulating hormone level is 15 mIU/mL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Polycystic ovary syndrome (B) Hypothyroidism (C) Hyperprolactinemia (D) Premature ovarian failure
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has amenorrhea for 6 months, which could be caused by several factors, including polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and premature ovarian failure. The patient's follicle-stimulating hormone level is 15 mIU/mL, which is within the normal range. This suggests that the patient's ovaries are still functioning normally. The patient's body mass index is 24 kg/m2, which is not consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome. The patient has no symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as cold intolerance, constipation, or fatigue. The patient's prolactin level is not elevated, ruling out hyperprolactinemia. The patient's age and menstrual history suggest that premature ovarian failure is the most likely diagnosis. The answer is (D).

Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of worsening headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. She has been treated for migraines in the past but states that these symptoms are much worse than her usual migraines. She appears uncomfortable. Temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 126/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mild occipital-frontal headache with no other focal neurological deficits. There is no meningism. The patient's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 12,000/mm3, with 82% segmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (B) Perform a lumbar puncture (C) Order a CT scan of the head (D) Administer intravenous vancomycin
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, which could be caused by several factors, including meningitis. The patient's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 12,000/mm3, with 82% segmented neutrophils, which suggests that the patient has a bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms are worse than her usual migraines, and she has no focal neurological deficits or meningism. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole to cover possible bacter",C,D

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?
(A) Cefazolin (B) Ceftriaxone (C) Levofloxacin (D) Penicillin

He has a history of COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. His physical examination shows wheezing on pulmonary auscultation. His chest radiograph is not provided. Given the patient's history of COPD and the symptoms described, it is likely that the patient is experiencing an exacerbation of COPD. The addition of antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen is appropriate, as bacterial infections can exacerbate COPD symptoms. The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity of the exacerbation and the patient's history of antibiotic use. In this case, the patient's history of smoking and hospitalizations for similar symptoms suggests a severe exacerbation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are warranted. The choice between ceftriaxone and levofloxacin is appropriate, as both are effective against common respiratory pathogens. However, given the patient's history of smoking, the risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is higher, and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) or ceftriaxone (Rocephin) would be a better choice. The answer is (B).

Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. She has been having difficulty walking because of weakness in her legs. She has no fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath. She has no history of cancer. She has been taking oral contraceptives for 10 years. She has no history of smoking or drug use. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows proteinuria (300 mg/day), and a 24-hour urine protein collection shows 1,500 mg/day. The patient's hemoglobin is 10 g/dL, leukocyte count is 4,000/mm3, and platelet count is 150,000/mm3. Serum creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL, and a 24-hour urine protein collection shows 1,500 mg/day. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension.

A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
(A) Deficient heme synthesis (B) Deficient erythropoietin secretion (C) Deficient nitrogenous base production (D) Deficient β-globin chains

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A previously healthy 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?
(A) Abstain from breastfeeding (B) Administer ampicillin intrapartum (C) Perform amniocentesis at 37 weeks (D) Administer intravenous immune globulin postpartum

The most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism is to administer ampicillin intrapartum. This will reduce the number of group B streptococcus in the birth canal, decreasing the chance of transmission to the neonate. The answer is (B).

Q: A 73-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. She is unable to raise her left arm or leg and has difficulty with language production. She is currently being treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia with lisinopril and simvastatin. She has no history of stroke or other neurological disorders. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 176/104 mm Hg. Physical examination shows left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria. The rest of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (B) Perform computed tomography (CT) of the brain without contrast (C) Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast (D) Administer aspirin
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. She is unable to raise her left arm or leg and has difficulty with language production. The most likely diagnosis is acute ischemic stroke. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases her risk for stroke. The patient's age also increases her risk for stroke. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a left middle cerebral artery territory infarction. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA is a thrombolytic agent that is effective in treating acute ischemic stroke. It works by breaking down blood clots and restoring blood flow to the affected area. tPA should be administered within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. The answer is (A).

Q: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe pain in his right scrotum that began 2 hours ago. He is currently being treated for hypertension with lisinopril. He has no history of genitourinary disorders. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 186/118 mm Hg. Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the right scrotum. There is no tenderness to palpation over the left scrotum. The right testicle is tender to palpation and swollen. The left testicle is normal in size and consistency. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intramuscular ceftriaxone and metronidazole (B) Administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (C) Perform scrotal ultrasonography (D) Perform scrotal exploration
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain in his right scrotum that began 2 hours ago. He has no history of genitourinary disorders. The most likely diagnosis is testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent loss of the testicle. The patient's symptoms are consistent with testicular torsion. The patient's age and history of hypertension increase his risk for testicular torsion. The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with testicular torsion. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform scrotal exploration. Scrotal exploration is the gold standard for diagnosing testicular torsion. The answer is (D).

She has a history of a heart murmur that was never treated. Physical examination reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. The most likely diagnosis is atrial septal defect. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a congenital heart defect. Atrial septal defect is a common congenital heart defect that can cause a harsh, systolic ejection murmur and can lead to cyanosis (pale or blue color of the skin) if left untreated. The other options, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great vessels, and pulmonary hypoplasia, can also cause similar symptoms, but are less likely given the patient's age and physical examination findings. The answer is (D).

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous metoclopramide (B) Administer intravenous haloperidol (C) Administer intravenous furosemide (D) Perform lumbar puncture
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of migraine headaches and is experiencing a severe headache, fever, and nausea. She has no meningism. A noncontrast head CT has been obtained, which is appropriate for evaluating the patient's symptoms. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a lumbar puncture to evaluate for meningitis or encephalitis. This is because the patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible infectious etiology, and a lumbar puncture would help to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. Administering intravenous metoclopramide (option A) or haloperidol (option B) would not be appropriate at this time, as they are not indicated for the patient's current symptoms. Administering intravenous furosemide (option C) may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms are related to a fluid imbalance, but this would not be the most appropriate next step in management. The answer is (D).

Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: An 18-year-old male is brought in by fire rescue. The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle after collision. Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT. This patient's presentation can best be explained by which of the following diagnoses?
(A) Air embolization (B) Tension pneumothorax (C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (D) Coagulopathy of trauma

Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 64-year-old man presents with severe respiratory distress. This has onset over the past 3 weeks, progressively worsening. Past history involves congestive heart failure (CHF). Due to concerns of concurrent pneumonia, sputum studies are ordered. Microscopic examination of his sputum demonstrates heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?
(A) Leaden paralysis (B) Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning (C) Stereotypies (D) Mania

The patient has gained 9.1 kg (20 lb) and eats out several times a week, sometimes consuming 2 whole meals in one sitting. This could be due to comfort eating, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the patient has difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time, which could be due to hypersomnia, another symptom of depression. The patient does not have any suicidal thoughts or plans, which is important to assess in patients with depression. The patient's excitement to see his children and the fact that it's the one thing keeping him going, suggests that he has some level of hope and optimism, which is a good sign. The patient's lack of interest in activities and decreased focus at work is also consistent with depression. The patient's physical exam is normal. The most likely symptom present in this patient is depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning. The answer is (B).

(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?
(A) Alkaline phosphatase (B) RNase (C) Superoxide dismutase (D) Telomerase

Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?",(A) Alkaline phosphatase (B) RNase (C) Superoxide dismutase (D) Telomerase,"The patient has painless swelling over his right leg, which has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He has a family history of lipomas over the extremities. However, after surgical resection, the tumor is diagnosed as a liposarcoma, which is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare and account for less than 1% of all adult soft tissue tumors. They are more common in the extremities than in the trunk. The most common subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma are leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. The most common subtype of liposarcoma is the well-differentiated lipomatous tumor, which accounts for approximately 70% of all liposarcomas. The tumor cells have increased alkaline phosphatase activity, which is a marker for liposarcoma. The answer is (A).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.

Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?
(A) Post-operative swelling (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation (C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (D) Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow

This could be caused by several factors. The most likely cause of this phenomenon is (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation. A septal hematoma is a collection of blood that accumulates in the septum, which can cause a perforation or a hole in the septum. This can lead to a whistling noise when the patient breathes through their nose. Option (A) Post-operative swelling is not the most likely cause of the whistling noise, as it would not cause a perforation in the septum. Option (C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow, is also not the most likely cause, as a deviated septum would not typically cause a whistling noise. Option (D) Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow is also not the most likely cause, as excessive columellar show would not typically cause a whistling noise. The answer is (B).

Q: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of worsening left knee pain and swelling. He denies any recent trauma or injuries. He has no significant medical history. On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are normal. There is moderate swelling of the left knee, with erythema and warmth of the skin. The patient has limited mobility of the knee due to pain. There is no evidence of an effusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Radiographs of the knee (B) Ultrasonography of the knee (C) Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee (D) Arthrocentesis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has worsening left knee pain and swelling, with no recent trauma or injuries. The patient has limited mobility of the knee due to pain, and there is no evidence of an effusion. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform (D) Arthrocentesis. Arthrocentesis is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that involves withdrawing fluid from a joint. It can help to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. It is also useful in diagnosing joint conditions such as arthritis, infection, or bleeding. Imaging studies such as radiographs (A), ultrasonography (B), or magnetic resonance imaging (C) may also be considered, but arthrocentesis is the most appropriate next step in this case. The answer is (D).

Q: A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease is evaluated for worsening left leg swelling. She denies any recent travel or illness. She has been compliant with her medications and has not noticed any changes in her urine output. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, heart rate is 80/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. There is pitting edema of the left leg, which extends from the foot to the knee. There is also mild tenderness to palpation over the left calf. The patient's urinalysis shows 2+ protein and active sediment. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Initiate furosemide therapy (B) Perform venous ultrasonography (C) Perform arterial Doppler studies (D) Admit the patient for observation
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has worsening left leg swelling, with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's urinalysis shows 2+ protein and active sediment. The patient's blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, which is uncontrolled. The patient's left leg swelling could be caused by nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. The most appropriate next step in management would be to (A) Initiate furosemide therapy. Furosemide is a diuretic that helps to reduce fluid retention and lower blood pressure. It is commonly used to treat ne",B,B

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

He admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute coronary syndrome. The most likely agent responsible for the patient's presentation is cocaine. Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor that can cause coronary artery vasoconstriction, leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction. The mechanism of action of cocaine is the blocking of reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, which leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. This can cause vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs.
