"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L
An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?
(A) Antinuclear antibody (B) Hepatitis C virus antibodies (C) JAK-2 mutation (D) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test

Q: In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
(A) No prevalence assessment (B) Low number of patients (C) Ascertainment bias (D) Lack of risk calculation

The authors were satisfied with their findings and submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study. However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The reason for this suggestion is likely due to the low number of patients in the study. The study had only 14 patients, which is a relatively small sample size. A case series is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, and it is typically used when there are fewer than 30 patients. Since the study had fewer than 30 patients, the journal editor suggested that it should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Q: A 29-year-old woman who is in her 26th week of pregnancy comes to the emergency department because of sudden onset of severe headache, blurred vision, and vomiting. She has been feeling unwell for the past 2 days but has not had any significant symptoms. She has no significant medical history. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and her pulse is 120/min. Physical examination shows conjunctival injection, and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. There is no evidence of a left-sided stroke. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform an urgent caesarean section (B) Administer intravenous magnesium sulfate (C) Perform an emergency left internal carotid artery ligation (D) Administer intravenous labetalol
A: Let's think step by step. The patient is 29 years old and 26 weeks pregnant. She presents with sudden onset of severe headache, blurred vision, and vomiting. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and her pulse is 120/min. Physical examination shows conjunctival injection, and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed.

The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 67-year-old woman presents from home hospice with a change in her mental status. She has seemed more confused lately and is unable to verbalize her symptoms.

(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination.

(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 60-year-old woman presents to a physician for worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distention over the last 3 months. She says that the shortness of breath is worse on exertion and improves with rest. While she could previously walk to the nearby store for her groceries, she now has to drive because she gets ''winded'' on the way. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and is compliant with her medications. The medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination reveals gross ascites and visibly engorged periumbilical veins. Bilateral pitting edema is noted around the ankles. The finger-prick blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL. What is the mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic medication this patient is most likely taking?
(A) Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor (B) Closure of ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell (C) Increased gene expression of GLUT-4 (D) Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist

The patient is taking an anti-diabetic medication. The patient's blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. The patient is not experiencing any symptoms of hypoglycemia. The patient's shortness of breath and abdominal distention are likely due to the medication's mechanism of action. The patient is most likely taking metformin. Metformin works by binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor. This causes the pancreatic beta-cells to release more insulin, which helps to lower blood glucose levels. The answer is (A).

Q: A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of sudden onset of severe chest pain. He has no history of cardiac disease and is currently not taking any medications. He has no allergies. He has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg. Physical examination shows clear lungs, no jugular venous distension, and regular heart sounds. There is no pedal edema. The patient's ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer aspirin (B) Administer clopidogrel (C) Administer heparin (D) Administer tPA
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of smoking and sudden onset of severe chest pain. The patient's blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg. The patient's ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. These are all signs of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer aspirin. Aspirin helps to prevent blood clots from forming, which can help to reduce the damage to the heart muscle. The answer is (A).

Q: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of progressive shortness of breath and cough. She has not had any fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis.

Q: A 30-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of worsening right flank pain. She has been nauseous but has not vomited. She has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows costovertebral angle tenderness and a positive jump sign. A renal ultrasound shows a 7-mm stone in the right ureter. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous pyelography (B) Perform open surgery (C) Administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (D) Perform ureteroscopy
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and is currently experiencing worsening right flank pain. She has costovertebral angle tenderness and a positive jump sign, which suggests that she has a ureteral stone. A renal ultrasound confirms the presence of a 7-mm stone in the right ureter. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that she has ureteral colic due to the stone. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform ureteroscopy, which is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to remove the stone. Intravenous pyelography (A) may be used to evaluate the collecting system anatomy and detect any obstruction, but it would not be the most appropriate step in this case. Open surgery (B) may be necessary if the stone cannot be removed with ureteroscopy, but it is not the first-line treatment. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (C) may be used to treat any associated urinary tract infection, but it would not be the most appropriate step in this case. The answer is (D).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:
(A) Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges (B) Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons (C) Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia (D) Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes

Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:

Viruses that spread to the CNS hematogenously (through the bloodstream) are most likely to cause meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Viruses that spread retrograde up peripheral nerve axons are most likely to cause Bell's palsy or other cranial nerve deficits. Viruses that reactivate from latency in dorsal root ganglia are most likely to cause shingles or other zoster-like illnesses. Viruses that infect oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are most likely to cause encephalitis.

The most likely diagnosis is encephalitis. The answer is (D).

At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. She has a history of hypertension and is taking lisinopril. Her blood pressure is 200/120 mm Hg. She appears uncomfortable. There are no focal neurologic deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous furosemide (B) Administer intravenous metoprolol (C) Perform a non-contrast head CT scan (D) Administer intravenous hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and is taking lisinopril. Her blood pressure is 200/120 mm Hg. She appears uncomfortable. There are no focal neurologic deficits. The patient's symptoms suggest a hypertensive emergency. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous medication to lower her blood pressure. The choice of medication would depend on the patient's response to medications, the presence of any comorbidities, and the patient's renal function. Intravenous furosemide is not appropriate because it is a diuretic and may worsen hypertension in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. Intravenous metoprolol is not appropriate because it is a beta-blocker and may lower the heart rate, which could worsen the patient's hypertension. A non-contrast head CT scan may be appropriate to rule out intracranial causes of hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Intravenous hydralazine is an appropriate medication to lower blood pressure quickly in a hypertensive emergency. The answer is (D).

The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Physical examination shows moderate tenderness to palpation over the right knee joint. There is no swelling or erythema. The patient walks with a cane and has a limping gait. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Osteoarthritis (B) Meniscal tear (C) Ligamentous sprain (D) Patellofemoral pain syndrome
A: Let's think step by step. The patient is a 26-year-old woman who presents with a 1-week history of worsening right knee pain. She has no history of previous knee injuries. She is currently taking oral contraceptives. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a knee injury. Osteoarthritis (A) is less likely given the patient's age and lack of previous knee injuries. Meniscal tear (B) and ligamentous sprain (C) are possible diagnoses, but patellofemoral pain syndrome (D) is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The answer is (D).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?
(A) Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles (B) Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate (C) Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis (D) Stromal amyloid deposition

His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 46-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of a cough for 6 months. He has been taking over-the-counter cough medications, but they have not helped much. He adds that he expectorated bloody sputum the previous night. He denies breathlessness but mentions that he frequently experiences fatigue after little physical exertion. There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?
(A) Bence-Jones protein (B) Calcitonin (C) CA 15-3 (D) Neuron-specific enolase

The chest x-ray shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. The diagnosis is small cell carcinoma of the lung. The patient has a history of smoking. Small cell carcinoma of the lung is a type of lung cancer that is strongly associated with smoking. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of bloody sputum suggest that the cancer has spread to the lungs. The most likely protein to be elevated in his serum is neuron-specific enolase. Neuron-specific enolase is a protein that is produced by neurons and is often elevated in the serum of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. The answer is (D).

Q: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 1-hour history of sudden onset of severe, substernal pain. He has no prior history of cardiac disease. He appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a regular rhythm, no murmurs, and no jugular venous distension. A 12-lead ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (B) Administer aspirin (C) Administer clopidogrel (D) Administer tPA
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a sudden onset of severe, substernal pain. He has no prior history of cardiac disease. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. This is consistent with a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The most appropriate next step in management is to administer tPA. tPA is a thrombolytic agent that is used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart. It is most effective when given within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. The answer is (D).

She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation.

She is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Her vital signs are stable, and her arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.44, pO2 54 mm Hg, pCO2 31 mm Hg, and HCO3- 22 mm Hg. These values indicate that the patient has respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. The patient's respiratory rate is 12/min, which is low. The tidal volume is 1000 mL, which is appropriate. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 2.5 cm H2O, which is also appropriate. The FiO2 is 50%, which is appropriate. The patient's lung examination shows bilateral rales, which indicates that the patient has pulmonary congestion. The patient's abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions, which indicates that the patient's bowel obstruction has not resolved. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates that the patient has metabolic acidosis due to hypoventilation. The patient's low respiratory rate and bilateral rales suggest that the patient is not receiving enough oxygen. The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to increase the respiratory rate to 18–20/min to improve oxygenation and to monitor the patient's blood gas levels closely.

She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden hearing loss and severe vertigo that started 2 hours ago. She has no history of hearing loss or vertigo. She denies recent infections, head trauma, or recent medication use. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a Weber Class III/IV hearing loss and a positive head thrust test. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous steroids (B) Administer intravenous antibiotics (C) Order an MRI of the internal auditory meatus (D) Order a CT scan of the temporal bone
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden hearing loss and severe vertigo. The patient has no history of hearing loss or vertigo. She denies recent infections, head trauma, or recent medication use. Physical examination shows a Weber Class III/IV hearing loss and a positive head thrust test. The patient has no other symptoms. Sudden hearing loss and severe vertigo are consistent with Meniere's disease. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Meniere's disease typically affects one ear. The most appropriate next step in management is to order an MRI of the internal auditory meatus. The MRI will help to rule out other causes of sudden hearing loss and vertigo, such as a tumor or inflammation. The answer is (C).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 35-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by a concerned neighbor who says that the patient is often seen setting up bear traps all around her property because of an impending ‘invasion of the mole people.’ The patient has come to the clinic wearing a garlic necklace. She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?
(A) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (B) The patient does not require any intervention (C) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (D) Refer to outpatient group therapy

The patient is wearing a garlic necklace to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. The patient has no past psychiatric history and denies hearing voices or seeing objects. The patient has a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. The patient's behavior is consistent with delusional disorder. Delusional disorder is a mental health condition characterized by one or more non-bizarre delusions that last for at least one month. The patient's delusion about the mole people invasion is a non-bizarre delusion because it could potentially happen in reality, although it is highly unlikely. The best initial course of treatment for this patient would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps people identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is effective in treating delusional disorder and can help the patient identify and challenge their delusional beliefs. The answer is (A).

His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of drowsiness at work for the past several months. He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?
(A) Methylphenidate (B) Sodium oxybate (C) Imipramine (D) Increase daytime naps

He has a normal sleep schedule and does not snore or stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. This suggests that the patient has excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The most appropriate treatment for EDS is sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate is a central nervous system depressant that can help manage EDS by increasing the amount of deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Methylphenidate and imipramine are not appropriate for the treatment of EDS. Increasing daytime naps can exacerbate EDS. The answer is (B).

Q: A 43-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She denies vaginal bleeding, fever, or recent travel. She has had no recent changes in bowel habits or appetite. She has had no recent unprotected sexual exposures. She has had no recent urinary tract infections. She is currently menstruating. Her last menstrual period was 2 days ago. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows marked tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The patient is at low risk for an ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intramuscular methotrexate (B) Perform a stat abdominal and pelvic CT scan (C) Administer intravenous cefoxitin (D) Perform a stat ultrasound of the pelvis

It transilluminates, meaning it is fluid-filled. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. These findings suggest that the mass is not a solid tumor. The patient's history of smoking and his father's history of seminoma at a young age suggest that the patient may be at risk for a testicular tumor. However, the absence of any abnormalities on examination of the testis makes a testicular tumor less likely. The patient's history of hypertension treated with enalapril and the absence of any other symptoms suggest that the mass is unlikely to be caused by a patent processus vaginalis or dilation of the pampiniform plexus. Twisting of the spermatic cord is also less likely given the absence of any abnormalities on examination of the testis. The most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which can cause a hydrocele. The answer is (D).

Q: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden onset of severe back pain, difficulty speaking, and difficulty walking.

(A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?
(A) Diffuse alveolar damage (B) Ventricular septal defect (C) Myocardial free wall rupture (D) Myocardial reinfarction

The most likely direct cause of his death is myocardial free wall rupture. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as oxygen desaturation, air entry, and crackles, suggest that the patient had a pulmonary embolism. The chest x-ray shows a large pulmonary embolism. The patient's history of a recent surgery and the presence of a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen suggest that the patient had a surgical injury. The patient's vital signs and the presence of ST elevations in multiple leads during surgery suggest that the patient had cardiac ischemia. The patient's death is most likely due to a myocardial free wall rupture caused by the surgical injury and cardiac ischemia. The answer is (C).

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?

She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Keratoacanthoma (B) Basal cell carcinoma (C) Seborrheic keratosis (D) Kaposi's sarcoma

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Results from a complete blood count are shown below:
Hemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl
Hematocrit: 35%
Leukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3
Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
(A) Interleukin 2 (B) Interleukin 8 (C) Interleukin 11 (D) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor

A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?",(A) Interleukin 2 (B) Interleukin 8 (C) Interleukin 11 (D) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor,"The patient has metastatic small cell lung carcinoma and is currently on chemotherapy. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he has developed multiple “spots” all over his body. The patient's past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. His complete blood count shows a low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, low leukocyte count, and low platelet count. The patient's history of paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome and the low platelet count suggest that the patient may have developed thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration by the cancer cells. The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the patient's low platelet count may limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. The most appropriate recombinant version in this patient is Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (D). G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells and platelets, which can help to improve the patient's low platelet count. The answer is (D).

Q: A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden onset of left-sided weakness, left-sided facial droop, and difficulty speaking. She is unable to walk and has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. She has no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. The patient's temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 200/100 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a left hemiparesis, left facial weakness, and slurred speech. There is no evidence of aphasia or neglect. The patient's National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 12. A noncontrast head CT scan shows an acute left hemispheric ischemic stroke. The patient is given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and is admitted to the stroke unit. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous heparin (B) Administer intravenous aspirin (C) Administer subcutaneous heparin (D) Administer subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden onset of left-sided weakness, left-sided facial droop, and difficulty speaking. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular event. The patient's physical examination and CT scan confirm the diagnosis of an acute left hemispheric ischemic stroke. The patient has been given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and has been admitted to the stroke unit. The next step in management would be to administer intravenous heparin (A). Heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant in the management of acute stroke. It helps to prevent further thrombus formation and can help to improve the patient's symptoms. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen.

She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. These symptoms are consistent with congestive heart failure. The prescribed medication is likely an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors reduce the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which decreases the production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that also increases aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. By decreasing angiotensin II production, ACE inhibitors reduce vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and sodium reabsorption. This decreases blood pressure and reduces fluid retention, which helps to alleviate the symptoms of congestive heart failure. The mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption. The answer is (C).

She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension.

Q: A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?
(A) Doxycycline (B) Ciprofloxacin (C) Erythromycin (D) Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time
A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing.

Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?",(A) Doxycycline (B) Ciprofloxacin (C) Erythromycin (D) Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time,"The patient has a history of COPD and has been smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He has recently quit smoking. He presents with a persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. These symptoms and examination findings are consistent with an exacerbation of COPD. The patient should be treated with antibiotics, as bacterial infections can exacerbate COPD. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by the patient's history of antibiotic use and any allergies they may have. The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases the likelihood of respiratory infections such as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin are all effective antibiotics for treating respiratory infections. However, since the patient has been taking a short-acting β-agonist, doxycycline would be the best choice, as it is less likely to interact with the β-agonist. The answer is (A).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 188/108 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-defined, tender, and warm area over the right calf. There is no localized swelling or erythema. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 13.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 7,800/mm3, and platelet count is 238,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Doppler ultrasonography of the right leg (B) Intravenous heparin (C) Intravenous naftripyione (D) Arteriography of the right leg
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral artery disease. He presents with a 2-day history of worsening pain in his right calf. He has been unable to ambulate due to the pain. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute arterial insufficiency. The most likely diagnosis is acute arterial insufficiency. Acute arterial insufficiency is a sudden reduction in blood flow to a limb, usually caused by a blood clot or other blockage in the artery. It is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. The patient's age, history of peripheral artery disease, and symptoms are consistent with acute arterial insufficiency. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: In a study, 2 groups are placed on different statin medications, statin A and statin B. Baseline LDL levels are drawn for each group and are subsequently measured every 3 months for 1 year.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina.

A: Let's think step by step.",Q: A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?,(A) 64 (B) 16 (C) 8 (D) 4,"The patient has unstable angina and cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. The reduction in diameter reduces blood flow. The increased resistance to blood flow in this vessel is directly proportional to the reduction in diameter. The factor by which resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased can be calculated using the Poiseuille's law, which states that the pressure drop (resistance) in a blood vessel is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius. The reduction in diameter is 50%, which means the radius is reduced by half. Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by a factor of 16. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain.

Q: A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?
(A) Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation (B) Refer this case to the court (C) Contact another family member for consent (D) Report the daughter to the police

Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?
(A) Increased water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts (B) Vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, aldosterone release (C) Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation (D) Increased plasma calcium and decreased renal reabsorption of phosphate

It is produced by the heart and acts on the kidneys to increase sodium excretion and water reabsorption. The experimental analog of ANP is likely to have a similar effect on the body. Therefore, the patient would expect to experience increased water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts. The answer is (A).

Q: A 34-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital because of fever, chills, and a 2-day history of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. She has a history of infertility and has been trying to conceive for 2 years. She has been taking clomiphene citrate for 6 months. She has no significant medical history. On physical examination, her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 104/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. There is tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, with guarding and rebound tenderness. A pelvic ultrasound shows a 3.5-cm left ovarian cyst. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Ovarian torsion (B) Ectopic pregnancy (C) Ruptured ovarian cyst (D) Endometriosis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of infertility and has been taking clomiphene citrate for 6 months. She presents with fever, chills, and worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pelvic ultrasound shows a 3.5-cm left ovarian cyst. The patient's symptoms and the presence of an ovarian cyst suggest a possible diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst. This is a known side effect of clomiphene citrate. The answer is (C).

Q: A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) presents for a routine follow-up. He takes no medications and has no significant medical history. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. There is a large, firm, and nodular prostate that is not tender to palpation. A urinalysis shows 2+ proteinuria and a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.4. A serum creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Start lisinopril, 20 mg orally daily (B) Start finasteride, 5 mg orally daily (C) Start metformin, 500 mg orally twice daily (D) Start alfuzosin, 10 mg orally daily
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). He has a large, firm, and nodular prostate that is not tender to palpation. The urinalysis shows 2+ proteinuria and a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.4. The patient has proteinuria, which could be a sign of kidney damage. The patient also has a high serum creatinine level, which suggests that his kidneys are not functioning properly. The patient's hypertension and proteinuria suggest that he may have kidney disease. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start lisinopril, 20 mg orally daily, to help lower his blood pressure and protect his kidneys. The answer is (A).

Q: A 47-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of worsening left lower extremity pain.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?
(A) Metformin (B) Oxybutynin (C) Metoprolol (D) Lisinopril

The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

She also has a history of binge eating and purging behavior. This history is consistent with bulimia nervosa. The patient is not currently experiencing suicidal ideation. The patient has a history of depression and bulimia nervosa. The most appropriate medication for this patient would be fluoxetine (Prozac). Bupropion (Wellbutrin) and citalopram (Celexa) are also appropriate medications for depression, but they are not as effective for bulimia nervosa. Trazodone is primarily used for insomnia and is not as effective for depression or bulimia nervosa. The answer is (D).

Q: A 25-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain that started 1 hour ago. She appears uncomfortable. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows marked tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. There is no vaginal bleeding. The patient is currently taking no medications. She has no significant medical history. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous morphine (B) Obtain a stat ultrasound (C) Administer intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole (D) Perform a stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. She appears uncomfortable and has no significant medical history. The most likely diagnosis is appendicitis. The next step in management is to obtain a stat ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. Administering intravenous morphine would not be appropriate at this time, as it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's pain. Administering intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole would be appropriate if the patient had a confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Performing a stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may be necessary if the ultrasound is equivocal or if there are other concerning findings on examination, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The answer is (B).

Q: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of sudden-onset left-sided chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. He appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a regular heart rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no evidence of jugular venous distension. The patient's chest is clear to auscultation, with no wheezes or rhonchi. The patient has a history of hypertension and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous nitroglycerin (B) Administer intravenous furosemide (C) Perform an electrocardiogram (D) Administer intravenous lidocaine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden-onset left-sided chest pain, a history of hypertension, and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. The most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome. The next step in management is to perform an electrocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis. Administering intravenous nitroglycerin would not be appropriate at this time, as it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's pain. Administering intravenous furosemide would not be appropriate, as it is a diuretic and has no role in the management of acute coronary syndrome. Administering intravenous lidocaine would not be appropriate, as it is a local anesthetic and has no role in the management of acute coronary syndrome. The answer is (C).
