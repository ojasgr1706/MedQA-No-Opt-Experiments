"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?
(A) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report (B) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake (C) Report the physician to the ethics committee (D) Refuse to dictate the operative report

Q: A 45-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with acute onset left-sided chest pain that radiates to his left arm. His blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and his heart rate is 100/min. He appears to be in distress. An ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (B) Administer intravenous furosemide (C) Administer intravenous metoprolol (D) Perform pericardiocentesis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has acute onset left-sided chest pain that radiates to his left arm, and his blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and his heart rate is 100/min. He appears to be in distress. An ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V6. This is consistent with a myocardial infarction. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous metoprolol to reduce the heart rate and blood pressure, which would decrease the amount of myocardial damage. Sublingual nitroglycerin could be given if the patient's blood pressure is not controlled. Administering intravenous furosemide would not be appropriate, as it is a diuretic and has no role in the acute management of myocardial infarction. Performing pericardiocentesis would not be appropriate, as it is a procedure to remove fluid from the pericardial sac surrounding the heart and is not needed in this situation. The answer is (C).

Q: A 66-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and chronic back pain presents to the clinic for a routine follow-up. She has been taking alendronate for several years and denies any recent changes in her symptoms or medications. Her current medications include alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D. She has no history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorders. On physical examination, she has a slight kyphosis and tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. Her lumbar spine BMD shows a T-score of -2.5. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Order a lumbar spine MRI (B) Order a hip BMD (C) Increase alendronate dose (D) Switch to risedronate
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of osteoporosis and chronic back pain.

She has no history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorders. On physical examination, she has a slight kyphosis and tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. Her lumbar spine BMD shows a T-score of -2.5. This indicates that the patient has osteoporosis. The most appropriate next step in management would be to order a lumbar spine MRI to assess for any vertebral fractures. Ordering a hip BMD would not be appropriate, as the patient's lumbar spine BMD is already showing a T-score of -2.5, indicating osteoporosis. Increasing the alendronate dose would not be appropriate, as the patient has been taking alendronate for several years and denies any recent changes in her symptoms or medications. Switching to risedronate would not be appropriate",B,B

A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

She appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a regular heart rate and rhythm, clear lungs, and a soft, non-tender abdomen. There is no evidence of a neurological deficit. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVL, consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. The patient is experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The most appropriate next step in management is to administer aspirin and heparin, which are both anti-clotting medications that can help to dissolve the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet medication that can also help to prevent blood clots from forming, but it is not as urgently needed as aspirin and heparin in this situation. Tissue plasminogen activator is a medication that can dissolve blood clots, but it is not appropriate for use in this situation. Cardiac catheterization is a procedure that can be used to open up blocked coronary arteries, but it is not an emergency intervention and can be planned after stabilization. The answer is (A).

The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?
(A) Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces (B) Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region (C) Erosions of the dental enamel (D) Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border

The nails are thickened and have a yellowish discoloration. This is most consistent with onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nails. This is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of fungi, including dermatophytes, yeast, and mold-like fungi. The patient has no other symptoms, such as skin lesions or mucosal lesions, which could suggest a more systemic infection. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications, which makes it less likely that she has a systemic infection. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also make it less likely that she has a systemic infection. The answer is (A).

Q: A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of sudden-onset severe headache, blurred vision, and difficulty speaking. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He takes no medications. He appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits.

The left pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform fundoscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Administer intravenous steroids (D) Administer intravenous anticoagulation
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a sudden-onset severe headache, blurred vision, and difficulty speaking. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He appears uncomfortable. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with acute ischemic stroke. The patient's age, history of hypertension, and smoking increase his risk for stroke. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a stroke affecting the left hemisphere of the brain. The patient's visual acuity and pupillary dilation suggest a possible posterior communicating artery stroke. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to confirm the diagnosis of stroke and to identify the location and extent of the stroke. The answer is (A).

Q: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, and a non-productive cough. She has been feeling tired and has had nocturnal sweats.

Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?
(A) An increase in right atrial pressure (B) An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (C) A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential (D) A reduction in diastolic filling time

A mid-systolic murmur is heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. When the patient stands up, gravity will cause the blood to flow downwards and increase the pressure in the lower extremities. This increased pressure will be transmitted to the heart and increase the right atrial pressure. The answer is (A).

Q: A 27-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden loss of vision in the left eye that occurred 2 hours ago. She has no history of similar episodes, headaches, or eye pain. She has no significant medical history. On examination, her visual acuity is 20/200 in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. There is no relative afferent pupillary defect. The IOP is 14 mm Hg in each eye. The remainder of the examination is normal. Fluorescein angiography shows a large area of hypoperfusion in the left eye. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Central retinal vein occlusion (B) Central retinal artery occlusion (C) Branch retinal vein occlusion (D) Hypertensive retinopathy
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden loss of vision in the left eye, which suggests that there is a problem with the blood flow to the retina. Fluorescein angiography shows a large area of hypoperfusion in the left eye, which supports the diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion. Central retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the main vein that carries blood away from the retina. This can cause vision loss or blindness in the affected eye. The answer is (A).

The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors).

Q: A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?
(A) IL-2 (B) IL-10 (C) IL-13 (D) IL-4

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?
(A) 22q11 deletion (B) Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 (C) Lithium exposure in utero (D) Maternal alcohol consumption

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?
(A) Immunoglobulin class switching (B) Superoxide dismutase (C) Myeloperoxidase (D) Respiratory burst
A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",(A) Immunoglobulin class switching (B) Superoxide dismutase (C) Myeloperoxidase (D) Respiratory burst,"The patient has recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. This could be due to a dysfunction in the respiratory burst. The respiratory burst is the ability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to bacteria and other microorganisms. The respiratory burst is mediated by the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO is responsible for the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid, which is toxic to bacteria. The patient's failure to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test suggests that the patient's neutrophils are unable to produce ROS, which could be due to a dysfunction in the myeloperoxidase enzyme. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Q: A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his family because of confusion and disorientation. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He has been taking lithium for the past 5 years. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's serum lithium level is 1.9 mEq/L (N = 0.6-1.2). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Admit the patient for further management of acute renal failure (B) Administer intravenous fluids and observe the patient closely (C) Discontinue lithium and substitute with a different mood stabilizer (D) Administer a loop diuretic and observe the patient closely
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He has been taking lithium for the past 5 years. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's serum lithium level is 1.9 mEq/L (N = 0.6-1.2). This suggests that the patient has lithium toxicity. Lithium toxicity can cause confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms. The most appropriate next step in management is to discontinue lithium and substitute with a different mood stabilizer. The answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?
(A) Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone (B) Induction of CYP2A6 by rifampin leading to increased inactivation of ethinylestradiol (C) Interference with the intestinal absorption of the oral contraceptive by pyrazinamide (D) Increased renal elimination of the progesterone component of the oral contraceptive by ethambutol

She is also taking medication for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Rifampin is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2A6. CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone. CYP2A6 is responsible for the metabolism of ethinylestradiol. The induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 by rifampin leads to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, which could explain the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient. The answer is (A).

Q: A 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus presents with a 2-day history of worsening substernal pain. The pain is described as a pressure sensation that radiates to the left arm and is exacerbated by physical activity. He also reports shortness of breath and diaphoresis. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-dressed man in moderate distress. There is a regular rhythm, no murmurs, and good air entry bilaterally. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative. An ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads V4-V6. A chest x-ray shows a prominent aortic arch. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (B) Administer intravenous furosemide (C) Administer intravenous metoprolol (D) Perform coronary angiography

Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",(A) 0.375 (B) 0.5 (C) 2.5 (D) 2.67,"The therapeutic index is the ratio of the dose of a drug that produces a therapeutic effect to the dose that produces adverse effects. In this case, the therapeutic effect is the improvement in the patient's condition, and the adverse effects are the treatment-related adverse events. The data provided shows the number of patients who demonstrated improvement and the number of patients who had a treatment-related adverse event for each dose of the drug. To calculate the therapeutic index, we need to divide the number of patients who demonstrated improvement by the number of patients who had a treatment-related adverse event for each dose. The therapeutic index is then the ratio of the dose of the drug that produces a therapeutic effect to the dose that produces adverse effects.

Using the data provided, we can calculate the therapeutic index for each dose of the drug:

10 mg dose: 6/59 = 0.102
20 mg dose: 19/49 = 0.388
30 mg dose: 26/53 = 0.472
40 mg dose: 46/51 = 0.902

The highest therapeutic index is achieved at a dose of 40 mg, which has a therapeutic index of 0.902. Therefore, the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent is (D) 2.67.

A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?

A: Let's think step by step.","Q: A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?",(A) Inferior vena cava (B) Coronary sinus (C) Pulmonary artery (D) Pulmonary vein,"The patient is undergoing an exercise stress test. The question asks about the oxygen content of blood at different locations before and after the stress test. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. The blood in the pulmonary artery has the lowest oxygen content because it has not yet been oxygenated by the lungs. The inferior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium. The blood in the inferior vena cava has a lower oxygen content than the blood in the pulmonary vein, which carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium. The coronary sinus is a vein that drains blood from the myocardium, and it does not play a role in oxygenation. The answer is (C).

Q: A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his family because they found him unresponsive in his bed. His family states that he has been increasingly confused over the past few days. The patient is afebrile and has a normal blood pressure. Physical examination shows a lethargic, unresponsive man with a decreased response to stimuli. There is no evidence of a stroke or seizure. The patient's recent medication history includes lithium, olanzapine, and zolpidem. The patient's recent laboratory test results show a lithium level of 1.9 mEq/L (N = 0.6–1.2). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Delirium (B) Lithium toxicity (C) Hypoglycemia (D) Hyponatremia
A: Let's think step by step. The patient is a 75-year-old man who is unresponsive and confused. The patient's recent medication history includes lithium, olanzapine, and zolpidem. The patient's recent laboratory test results show a lithium level of 1.9 mEq/L (N = 0.6–1.2). This is a toxic level of lithium. Lithium toxicity can cause delirium, confusion, and decreased responsiveness. The patient's symptoms are consistent with lithium toxicity. The answer is (B).

On admission, her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and her urine output has decreased. The patient is afebrile. Physical examination shows costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous furosemide (B) Discontinue mycophenolate mofetil (C) Increase the dose of prednisone (D) Perform renal ultrasonography
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis. She is currently taking mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. She has been receiving hemodialysis for the past 6 months. On admission, her blood pressure is 180/100 mm Hg, and her urine output has decreased. The patient is afebrile. Physical examination shows costovertebral angle tenderness. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute renal failure. The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis suggests that the acute renal failure is likely caused by membranous nephropathy. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform renal ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy. The answer is (D).

Q:",C,A
"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir.

Q: A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?
(A) Induces the formation of thymidine dimers (B) Induces the formation of disulfide bonds (C) Induces deamination of cytosine (D) Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA
A: Let's think step by step.",Q: A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?,(A) Induces the formation of thymidine dimers (B) Induces the formation of disulfide bonds (C) Induces deamination of cytosine (D) Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA,"Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells. This damage can lead to cell death or the inability of the cells to divide and grow. There are several ways that radiation can damage DNA, including:

* Inducing the formation of thymidine dimers: Radiation can cause two thymidine bases on one DNA strand to link improperly with an adenine on the opposing strand, creating a thymidine dimer. This can lead to mutations and cell death.
* Inducing the formation of disulfide bonds: Radiation can also cause the formation of disulfide bonds between two cysteine residues in proteins. This can alter the structure and function of proteins and contribute to cell death.
* Inducing deamination of cytosine: Radiation can cause the deamination of cytosine, which results in the conversion of cytosine to uracil. This can lead to mutations and cell death.
* Inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA: Radiation can also cause breaks in both strands of DNA, leading to double-strand breaks. This can be lethal to cancer cells.

Of the options, the answer is (D). Radiation affects cancer cells by inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA.",D,D

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",(A) Aldosterone excess (B) Catecholamine-secreting mass (C) Cortisol excess (D) Impaired kidney perfusion,"The patient has a history of hypertension, new-onset muscle cramps, and progressive fatigue. He is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg. His Na+ is 138 mEq/L, Cl- is 100 mEq/L, K+ is 3.3 mEq/L, HCO3- is 33 mEq/L, BUN is 20 mg/dL, and Glucose is 129 mg/dL. The patient's muscle cramps and fatigue suggest hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The patient's hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis (elevated HCO3-) suggest that the patient has primary aldosteronism (PA). Aldosterone excess can cause hypokalemia, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's potassium levels are low, which supports the diagnosis of aldosterone excess. The patient's blood pressure is high, which is consistent with the diagnosis of aldosterone excess. The patient's metabolic alkalosis (elevated HCO3-) is also consistent with the diagnosis of aldosterone excess. The patient's history of hypertension and new-onset muscle cramps also support the diagnosis of aldosterone excess. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?
(A) Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed (B) Patients do not usually initiate treatment (C) Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia (D) Patients will typically have a BMI between 17–18.5 kg/m2

(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night.

(A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?
(A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen (B) Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen (C) Liver transplantation (D) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting

Urine studies show a low urine sodium level without evidence of blood or protein. The patient has not been started on any new medications since his hospital admission. Given the patient's history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis, his current symptoms, and his laboratory test results, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotoxicity-related acute kidney injury. The best treatment option for this patient would be to discontinue the potentially nephrotoxic medications and manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the answer is (A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen. Dopamine is a medication that can help to improve renal function and reduce the risk of further nephrotoxicity. It is not appropriate to add lisinopril (B) or to consider liver transplantation (C) or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (D) at this time.",A,C

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?",(A) Coarctation of the aorta (B) Persistent truncus arteriosus (C) Transposition of great vessels (D) Tricuspid atresia,"The newborn is cyanotic and has progressive respiratory failure. There is a single loud S2 heart sound and a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. Radiography shows an enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart. These symptoms suggest that the newborn has a congenital heart defect. The most likely diagnosis is transposition of great vessels. This is a congenital heart defect in which the great vessels (aorta and pulmonary artery) are reversed, so that the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This results in deoxygenated blood being pumped to the body and oxygenated blood being pumped to the lungs, leading to cyanosis and respiratory failure. The atrial septostomy is a temporary measure to alleviate the condition until definitive surgical correction can be performed. The answer is (C).

Q: A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden onset of left-sided weakness, difficulty speaking, and difficulty walking. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He is currently taking aspirin, lisinopril, and simvastatin. His blood pressure is 178/104 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical examination shows left-sided hemiparesis, dysarthria, and ataxic gait. There is no evidence of a bleeding disorder. Urinalysis shows 3+ proteinuria and 2+ blood. The patient's electrolyte levels, BUN, and creatinine are within normal limits. A noncontrast head CT shows an acute left MCA infarction. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (B) Administer intravenous heparin (C) Administer aspirin (D) Administer clopidogrel
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has sudden onset of left-sided weakness, difficulty speaking, and difficulty walking, which are symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke. The noncontrast head CT confirms the diagnosis of an acute left MCA infarction. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA is a thrombolytic agent that can dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow to the affected area. It is most effective when given within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking increases the risk of stroke. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that can also be used to treat acute ischemic stroke, but they are not as effective as tPA in restoring blood flow to the affected area. Heparin is an anticoagulant that can prevent further clot formation, but it is not as effective as tPA in treating acute ischemic stroke. The answer is (A).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help.

(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension.

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?
(A) Exotoxin release (B) Antigenic variation (C) Polysaccharide capsule (D) Bruton's agammaglobulinemia

Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?",(A) Exotoxin release (B) Antigenic variation (C) Polysaccharide capsule (D) Bruton's agammaglobulinemia,"The patient has a urethral infection caused by gram-negative diplococci. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar, suggesting that it is likely a Neisseria species. The patient was prescribed a course of ceftriaxone, which is effective against Neisseria species, and the infection resolved without further complications. However, one year later, the patient returns with the same infection. This lack of lasting immunity could be due to antigenic variation, which is a mechanism used by some bacteria to evade the host's immune system. This allows the bacteria to cause recurrent infections in the same host. The answer is (B).

Q: A 42-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of worsening left knee pain and swelling. She reports that the pain has been worsening over the past year and that she has noticed a large amount of swelling in her knee over the past month. The patient has a history of osteoarthritis and has been taking ibuprofen as needed for pain. She denies any recent trauma or infection. On physical examination, the patient's left knee is swollen and tender to palpation. The patient's blood work shows an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Radiographs of the knee show evidence of osteoarthritis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (B) Knee arthroscopy (C) Total knee arthroplasty (D) Referral to physical therapy
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has worsening left knee pain and swelling over the past year, with a large amount of swelling over the past month. She has a history of osteoarthritis and has been taking ibuprofen as needed for pain. The patient's blood work shows an elevated ESR and CRP. Radiographs of the knee show evidence of osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that the patient has inflammatory osteoarthritis. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection is the most appropriate next step in management. Corticosteroid injections can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain in patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden onset of severe left chest pain. She has no history of cardiac disease or risk factors. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 110/min. Physical examination shows a normal cardiovascular examination. An electrocardiogram shows a 1-2 mm ST segment elevation in leads V2-V6. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Administer aspirin (B) Administer nitroglycerin (C) Administer tPA (D) Perform a cardiac catheterization
A: Let's think step by step. The patient presents with sudden onset of severe left chest pain, which suggests a possible myocardial infarction. She has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for cardiac disease. Her blood pressure and heart rate are elevated, which is consistent with a myocardial infarction. An electrocardiogram shows a 1-2 mm ST segment elevation in leads V2-V6, which is diagnostic of a myocardial infarction. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer aspirin, which can help reduce the risk of further cardiac damage by inhibiting platelet aggregation. The answer is (A).

At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 43-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, currently controlled with medication, comes in for an appointment with his internist. He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms.

Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely.

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about professional medicine.

Q: Four weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide, a 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the physician because of muscle cramps and weakness. His home medications also include amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 176/87 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The precordial leads of a 12-lead ECG are shown. The addition of which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
(A) Torsemide (B) Nifedipine (C) Eplerenone (D) Hydralazine
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has started hydrochlorothiazide. He now presents with muscle cramps and weakness and an ECG that supports the diagnosis of hypokalemia. The addition of (A) Torsemide is a loop diuretic and would likely aggravate the hypokalemia, (B) Nifedipine is a calcium antagonist and would not alleviate the hypocalcemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would likely decrease the chance of hypokalemia. (C) Eplerenone is a potent vasodilator and would not decrease the risk of hypokalemia. The answer is (C).

Q: A 57-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe pain around her right eye, blurred vision in the same eye, and a headache for the past 4 hours. She is nauseous but has not vomited. She can see colored bright circles when she looks at a light source. She is currently being treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows visual acuity of 20/20 in the left eye and counting fingers at 5 feet in the right eye. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. Intravenous analgesia and antiemetics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (B) Perform gonioscopy (C) Perform fundoscopy (D) Administer topical steroids
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has severe pain, blurred vision, and a headache. She is also nauseous but has not vomited. She can see bright colored circles when she looks at a light source. The right eye shows conjunctival injection and edema of the cornea. The right pupil is dilated and fixed. The tentative (most likely) diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms, is acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. Analgesics have been administered. The next step is to confirm the tentative diagnosis using the gold standard test. (A) ultrasound biomicroscopy could be used but are not widely available, (B) Gonioscopy is the gold-standard test to confirm the diagnosis of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, (C) fundoscopy is not as reliable as gonioscopy, (D) topical steroids is not relevant, the possible medical therapy would be timolol, apraclonidine or pilocarpine. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous analgesia and antiemetics. The answer is (B).

Q: A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia presents for follow-up 4 days into the treatment of a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His symptoms have resolved, and he reports no problems with urination, with the exception of a weak urine stream and hesitancy, which he has had for the past 2 years. At the time of this visit, the patient is afebrile; the blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 80/min. There is no flank tenderness. A urinalysis reveals no leukocytes and is negative for esterase. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality:
Prior treatment
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Today’s visit
BUN 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
(A) Reassure the patient, stop trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1–2 weeks (B) Schedule an intravenous pyelography for urinary obstruction (C) Schedule a cystoscopy for urethral obstruction (D) Admit the patient for further management of acute interstitial nephritis
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia. These are both risk factors for urinary tract infections. The patient is being treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The symptoms have resolved, but the patient has a weak urine stream and hesitancy. The urinalysis reveals 2 red blood cells (RBCs)/ high power field (HPF), and there are no casts on urinary sediment analysis. The physician, however, notices the following abnormality: BUN 12 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (prior treatment) vs BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (today’s visit). The BUN and creatinine levels have increased from the prior visit. This could be due to acute interstitial nephritis. A known but rare side effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interstitial nephritis should be suspected if there is an elevated creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Since none of the urinalysis results is present and the patient has no typical symptoms such as fever, rash, or acute interstitial nephritis is an unlikely diagnosis. The answer is (A).

Q: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles for the past 16 months. She began having symptoms of insomnia and depression 10 months ago. More recently, she has been having difficulties rising from a chair. She has a 2-year history of hypertension. Current medications include citalopram and hydrochlorothiazide. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb). BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. She appears tired and has a full, plethoric face and central obesity. Examination of the skin shows violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies show measurements of 288 μg/L and 253 μg/L (N < 90); a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement was 395 μg (N < 300). Upon follow-up laboratory examination, the patient's serum ACTH levels were also elevated at 136 pg/mL (N = 7–50). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
(A) MRI of the head with contrast (B) Measure ACTH levels in inferior petrosal sinuses (C) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by weight gain, generalized weakness, and irregular menstrual cycles. She also has symptoms of insomnia and depression, which could be caused by Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, she has difficulties rising from a chair, which could be caused by muscle weakness. The two elevated serum cortisol measurements and the elevated ACTH levels confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test will help determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease (CS caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH) or ectopic ACTH syndrome (CS caused by nonpituitary ACTH-secreting tumors). Since the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the most appropriate next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome using the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The answer is (C).

Q: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a nonpruritic rash. He has been feeling more tired than usual and occasionally experiences pain in his wrists and ankles. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple, erythematous, purpuric papules on his trunk and extremities that do not blanch when pressed. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient's hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,500/mm3, and platelet count is 228,000/mm3. Urinalysis and liver function tests are within normal limits. The test for rheumatoid factor is positive. Serum ANA is negative. Serum complement levels are decreased. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation shows increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. Testing for cryoglobulins shows no precipitate after 24 hours. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
(A) Rapid plasma reagin test (B) Hepatitis C serology (C) pANCA assay (D) Bence Jones protein test
A: Let's think step by step. The patient has a rash, fatigue, and pain in his wrists and ankles. He has normal hemoglobin (normal range 13.8-17.2 g/dL), normal leukocyte count (normal range 4500-11000 wbc/microliter), and normal platelet count (normal range 150-450 platelets/microliter). His serum complement levels are decreased. His serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show increased gammaglobulins with pronounced polyclonal IgM and IgG bands. The cryoglobulin precipitation test is normal, ruling out cryoglobulinemia. Serum ANA is negative, so Lupus is less likely. Physical examination and symptoms are consistent with possible non-cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The most likely associated diagnosis is Hepatitis C. The answer is (B).

Q: A 66-year-old male presents to his primary care physician to discuss his increasing shortness of breathover the last 3 months. He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?
(A) Mitral regurgitation (B) Aortic regurgitation (C) Aortic stenosis (D) Mitral prolapse
