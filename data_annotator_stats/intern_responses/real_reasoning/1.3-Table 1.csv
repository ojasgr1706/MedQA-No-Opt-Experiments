KJ,"The patient has had a previous normal Pap smear four years ago. She has had two new sexual partners since then and has experienced a severe vaginal infection that was treated with oral and vaginal medications about a year ago. She still experiences excessive vaginal discharge on and off. Her current Pap smear is reported as ASC-H (atypical squamous cells - cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). Her speculum examination reveals a large cervical erosion that bleeds on touch. The patient needs further testing to determine whether she has a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or cancer. An HSIL or cancer cannot be ruled out based on the Pap smear and physical examination findings. The next best clinical step for this patient would be to perform an colposcopy, which is a procedure that uses a special microscope to examine the cervix for any abnormal cells. If the colposcopy shows abnormal cells, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
",Codex,Strongly Agree,The patient is 26 years old and has had a previous normal pap smear 4 years ago. She has had 2 new sexual partners since then. She has had a history of severe vaginal infection a year ago which was treated with oral and vaginal medications. She still experiences excessive vaginal discharge on and off. Her current pap smear is reported as ASC-H which means that there are atypical squamous cells that cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Speculum examination shows a large cervical erosion which bleeds on touch. The presence of excessive vaginal discharge and a history of vaginal infections point towards a possible diagnosis of cervicitis. The abnormal pap smear and the presence of a large cervical erosion support this diagnosis. The next best step would be to perform an endocervical curettage to obtain a tissue sample from the cervix to confirm the diagnosis of cervicitis and rule out any precancerous changes.,KJ,Agree,Option 1

A 29 year old primigravida with 28 weeks gestation visited the ER complaining of reduced fetal movements on that day. She reports that this is an IVF conception and she has been on daily injections throughout her pregnancy. She reports that her last ultrasound examination had revealed reduced liquor around the baby and she has since been on bed rest. She does not have any pain or vaginal discharge or bleeding. She has been getting regular antenatal check ups and does not recall any raised blood pressure readings. What parameters in her ultrasound examination will be determinant of fetal wellbeing?,"The patient is a 29-year-old primigravida with 28 weeks gestation who visited the ER complaining of reduced fetal movements. She has been on daily injections throughout her pregnancy and her last ultrasound examination revealed reduced liquor around the baby. She has been on bed rest and does not have any pain, vaginal discharge, or bleeding. To assess fetal wellbeing, several parameters in her ultrasound examination will be important. Nonstress test (NST): This measures the fetal heart rate in response to the fetus's movement. It is a simple, noninvasive test that can detect changes in the fetal heart rate, which may indicate fetal distress. Biophysical profile (BPP): This is a more comprehensive test that evaluates fetal wellbeing by scoring various physical characteristics, such as breathing movements, body movements, and muscle tone. The BPP score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating better fetal wellbeing. Doppler ultrasound: This measures blood flow through the umbilical cord and can detect changes in blood flow that may indicate fetal distress. Fetal growth restriction (FGR): This refers to a situation where the fetus is not growing at a normal rate inside the womb. FGR can be detected by measuring the size of the fetus during ultrasound examinations. Amniotic fluid index (AFI): This measures the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. Low AFI can indicate fetal distress. Umbilical artery Doppler: This measures blood flow through the umbilical artery and can detect changes in blood flow that may indicate fetal distress.",Codex,Agree,"The patient is a primigravida with 28 weeks gestation and has a history of IVF conception. She has been on daily injections throughout her pregnancy and has been advised bed rest since the last ultrasound examination revealed reduced liquor around the baby. The patient does not report any pain, vaginal discharge or bleeding. The patient has been getting regular antenatal check-ups and does not recall any raised blood pressure readings. The patient's history of IVF conception and reduced liquor around the baby suggests that the fetus may be at risk of growth restriction or other complications. In this scenario, the ultrasound examination will play a crucial role in determining the fetal wellbeing. The parameters that will be important in assessing fetal wellbeing include:

1. Fetal biometry: Measurement of the fetal size, weight, and head circumference will help determine if the fetus is growing appropriately.
2. Fetal growth velocity: Assessment of the rate of fetal growth over time will help identify any changes in the fetal growth pattern.
3. Amniotic fluid index (AFI): Measurement of the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus will help evaluate fetal wellbeing. A low AFI may indicate fetal distress.
4. Umbilical artery Doppler: Assessment of blood flow through the umbilical artery will help evaluate fetal circulation and identify any potential issues with fetal perfusion.
5. Fetal heart rate monitoring: Assessment of the fetal heart rate and variability will help evaluate fetal stress and wellbeing.
6. Maternal serum markers: Measurement of maternal serum markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may help identify potential chromosomal abnormalities or other complications.

These parameters will provide valuable information in determining the fetal wellbeing and guide further management decisions.",,Strongly Agree,Option 2

2. Psychotherapy: The patient should be referred for psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to be effective in treating adolescent depression. CBT can help the patient identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with depression.
3. Medication: Antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered as an adjunct to therapy. However, it is important to note that antidepressants should not be prescribed without adequate psychotherapy.
4. Support and education: The patient's family and friends should be involved in her care and provided with education on depression and its management. They should also be aware of the warning signs of suicide and how to intervene.
5. Follow-up: Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment as needed.

It is important to note that the patient's safety is of utmost importance. If the patient is deemed to be at high risk of suicide, hospitalization may be necessary until the risk is reduced.",Codex,Strongly Agree,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has recently gone through a breakup with her boyfriend. She has been feeling sad, hopeless, and has lost interest in activities she once enjoyed. She has not been able to sleep or eat properly for the past week and has stopped attending college. She spends most of her time on her phone, crying and calling her ex-boyfriend, who is not responding to her calls. She has expressed a desire to end her life. Based on these symptoms, the diagnosis is likely to be major depressive disorder. The patient's behavior and thoughts suggest that she is experiencing a major depressive episode, which can be triggered by stressful life events such as a breakup. The patient's suicidal ideation also suggests that she may have a high risk of attempting suicide. The first step in managing this patient's condition would be to address her immediate safety concerns. The patient should be evaluated for suicide risk and if necessary, hospitalized for observation and safety. Next, a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation should be conducted to assess the severity of her depression and any potential underlying issues.

The cervix appears healthy and is contiguous with the mass. The patient has been experiencing heaviness and dull aching pain in her lower abdomen for the last 2-3 months. The patient's age and symptoms suggest that the mass may be related to reproductive organs. An MRI scan would be helpful in determining the nature of the mass. If the MRI shows a solid component with irregular margins, ill-defined borders, or areas of necrosis, it would indicate malignant potential. Other features that suggest malignancy include a large size (>5 cm), irregular shape, and enhancement after contrast administration.",Codex,Agree,"A 26-year-old woman presents with a 2-3 month history of lower abdominal heaviness and dull aching pain. She has no other abdominal complaints and her menses are regular and moderate in quantity. On abdominal examination, a firm mass is palpable in the abdomen, extending from the pelvis to the umbilicus, and is mobile and non-tender. On vaginal examination, the cervix appears healthy and is contiguous with the mass. The patient's age and symptoms suggest that the mass may be related to reproductive organs. The fact that the mass is firm, mobile, and non-tender suggests that it may be a fibroid. Fibroids are benign tumors that originate from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus. They are common in women of childbearing age and can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and infertility. However, it is important to consider the possibility of malignancy, especially in a patient with a rapidly growing mass. MRI features that may indicate malignant potential include:

1. Rapid growth: If the mass has grown significantly in size over a short period of time, it may indicate malignancy.
2. Irregular shape: A mass with an irregular shape may be more likely to be malignant than one with a round or oval shape.
3. Ill-defined margins: If the edges of the mass are not well-defined or are irregular, it may indicate malignancy.
4. Enhancement: If the mass demonstrates rapid enhancement or ""washout"" after the administration of contrast material, it may indicate malignancy.
5. Restricted diffusion: If the mass shows restricted diffusion on DWI sequences, it may indicate malignancy.
6. High signal intensity on T2-weighted images: If the mass demonstrates high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, it may indicate malignancy.
7. Low signal intensity on T1-weighted images: If the mass demonstrates low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, it may indicate malignancy.
8. Presence of necrosis or hemorrhage: If the mass demonstrates areas of necrosis or hemorrhage, it may indicate malignancy.

It is important to note that these features are not specific to malignancy and may also be seen in benign masses. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathology results to make a definitive diagnosis.",KJ,Strongly Agree,Option 2

"A 46 year old man visits an outpatient department of dermatology with sudden loss of scalp hair in patches. On a detailed examination, partial loss of eyelashes were noticed. Hair pull test was positive at the margins of the bald patches. On dermoscopic evaluation, black dots, yellow dots, broken and tapering hair were observed. What is the drug of choice to halt the progression of the disease?","The patient has sudden loss of scalp hair in patches, partial loss of eyelashes, a positive hair pull test at the margins of the bald patches, and characteristic findings on dermoscopic evaluation (black dots, yellow dots, broken and tapering hair). All these findings point towards alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp, eyebrows, and beards, as well as other areas of the body. It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy hair follicles, causing them to stop producing hair. The goal of treatment is to suppress the immune system and promote hair growth. The first-line treatment for patchy alopecia areata is intralesional triamcinolone injections. Triamcinolone is a type of steroid that helps reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It is injected directly into the affected area to promote hair growth and reduce hair loss. Therefore, the drug of choice to halt the progression of the disease is triamcinolone.
",Codex,Strongly Agree,"The patient presents with sudden loss of scalp hair in patches, which suggests the possibility of an autoimmune condition. The partial loss of eyelashes also supports this notion. The positive hair pull test at the margins of the bald patches further supports the diagnosis of an autoimmune condition.
