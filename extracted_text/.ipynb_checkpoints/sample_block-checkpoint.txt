This process occurs in the lung alveoli, where blood\nflowing through alveolar wall capillaries is separated from alveolar\ngas by an extremely thin membrane of flattened endothelial and\nepithelial cells, across which respiratory gases diffuse and\nequilibrate. Blood flow through the lung is unidirectional via a\ncontinuous vascular path along which venous blood absorbs oxygen\nfrom and loses CO2 to inspired gas. The path for airflow, in contrast,\nreaches a dead end at the alveolar walls; thus, the alveolar space\nmust be ventilated tidally, with inflow of fresh gas and outflow of\nalveolar gas alternating periodically at the respiratory rate (RR). To\nprovide an enormous alveolar surface area (typically 70 m2) for\nblood-gas diffusion within the modest volume of a thoracic cavity\n(typically 7 L), nature has distributed both blood flow and ventilation\namong millions of tiny alveoli through multigenerational branching of\nboth pulmonary arteries and bronchial airways. Ideally, for the lung to\nbe most efficient in exchanging gas, the fresh gas ventilation of a\ngiven alveolus must be matched to its perfusion. However, as a\nconsequence of variations in tube lengths and calibers along these\npathways as well as the effects of gravity, tidal pressure fluctuations,\nand anatomic constraints from the chest wall, the alveoli vary in their\nrelative ventilations and perfusions even in health.\n', 2, 0), (99.49214935302734, 593.1708984375, 521.3543701171875, 609.9287109375, 'For the respiratory system to succeed in oxygenating blood and\n', 3, 0), (76.9921875, 610.4208984375, 530.53466796875, 718.634033203125, 'eliminating CO2, it must be able to ventilate the lung tidally and thus\nto freshen alveolar gas; it must provide for perfusion of the individual\nalveolus in a manner proportional to its ventilation; and it must allow\nadequate diffusion of respiratory gases between alveolar gas and\ncapillary blood.
