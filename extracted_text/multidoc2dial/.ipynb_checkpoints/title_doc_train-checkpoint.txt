title : Benefits Planner | Social Security Credits and Benefit Eligibility | SSA#1
document : 
Social Security Credits 
You must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes. The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive. It only determines if you are eligible or not. You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits. We cannot pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits. We use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits, as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die. 
How Credits Are Earned 
Since 1978 , when you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year. Credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year. You might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time. The amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year. In 2020 , you earn one Social Security or Medicare credit for every $1,410 in covered earnings each year. You must earn $5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year. During your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits. These extra credits do not increase your benefit amount. The average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits. Read our publication, " How You Earn Credits, " for more information. 
Number Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits 
If you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement. 
Number Of Credits Needed For Disability Benefits 
To be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test. The number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age. The rules are as follows : Before age 24 - You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts. Age 24 to 31 In general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled. As a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. Age 31 or older - In general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled. The following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began. For the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period. The table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need. It does not cover all situations. If you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test. When statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement. NOTE : This table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations 
Number Of Credits Needed For Survivors Benefits 
The number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die. The younger you are , the fewer credits needed. Nobody needs more than 40 credits. Under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children, even if your record doesn't have the number of credits needed. They can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year's work 6 credits in the three years before your death. If you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement. We will not have to determine your credits again.

Most emails from Social Security will come from a .gov " email address. If an email address does not end in .gov , use caution before opening attachments or clicking on pictures or links in the email. Currently , Social Security sends emails from no-reply@ssa.gov, subscription.service@subscriptions.ssa.gov and ThankYou@ssa.gov.

Links, logos, or pictures in the body of an official Social Security email will always direct you to an official Social Security website. Rather than relying on the way a link looks , please follow these steps to confirm a link s authenticity : To verify the web address of a link or picture , hover over it with your mouse until a text box appears with the web address. This is the actual address you will be directed to and it should always end in .gov/ A forward slash should always follow the .gov domain. Example - https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ Links to the official Social Security website will always begin with https://www.socialsecurity.gov/ or https://secure.ssa.gov/. Below are examples of fraudulent websites pretending to direct you to Social Security.

Hover over the From email address to ensure it matches the displayed email or name of the sender. Look for poor choices in wording, phrasing, or spelling. If an email includes a business name, telephone number, or website link , verify the legitimacy of these items by searching for the official number or website in a search engine.

If your ex - spouse has not applied for retirement benefits, but can qualify for them, you can receive benefits on their record if you have been divorced for at least two years. If you are eligible for retirement benefits on your own record and divorced spouse's benefits , we will pay the retirement benefit first. If the benefit on your ex - spouse's record is higher , you will get an additional amount on your ex - spouse's record so that the combination of benefits equals that higher amount. If you continue to work while receiving benefits , the retirement benefit earnings limit still applies. If you are eligible for benefits this year and are still working , you can use our earnings test calculator to see how those earnings would affect your benefit payments.

Applying for Medicare Only 
If you are within three months of age 65 or older and not ready to start your monthly Social Security benefits yet , you can use our online retirement application to sign up just for Medicare and wait to apply for your retirement or spouses benefits later. Before you decide , you need to be sure that you understand how waiting until later will affect : the lifetime benefits we can pay on your account and your health insurance coverage. 
Lifetime Benefits We Can Pay On Your Record 
You can start your retirement benefit at any point from age 62 up until age 70. Your benefit amountwill be higher the longer you delay starting it. This adjustment is usually permanent. If you: Apply for benefits before full retirement age , your benefitswill be reduced because you are taking them earlier. (Full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954. Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If your full retirement age is 66 and you decideto start your retirement benefits at age 65 , your benefit will be 93.33 percent of yourfull benefit amount. Delay receiving retirement benefits until after you reach full retirementage any month up to age 70 , you can increase your benefit by accumulating Delayed Retirement Credits. If your full retirement age is 66 and 2 months and you wait until age 70 , your benefitwill be 130.67 percent of your full retirement age benefit. Have family members who qualify for benefits, a delay meansyou would lose some of the benefits they might have received. However , delaying benefitsalso increases the maximum monthly survivors benefit your spouse may receive. 
If You Plan To Continue Working 
Even if you plan to continue working , you may still be able to receive some benefits. If you areunder full retirement age and you earn over a certain amount , we will deduct the excess earnings from your benefits. If you delay receiving benefits until the month you reach full retirement age , you may receive yourbenefits with no limit on your earnings. For more information that will help you decide the best time to start benefits , please read Other Things To Consider.

To verify a birth record , Social Security will contact the office that issued it. All documents must be either originals or copies certified by the issuing agency. We cannot accept photocopies or notarized copies of documents. We also cannot accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. Get a certified copy of a document showing a birth, marriage or divorce that took place in the U.S. Adoption In some cases , we can assign your adopted child a number before the adoption is complete , but you may want to wait. Then , you can apply for the number using your child's new name. If you want to claim your child for tax purposes while the adoption is still pending , contact the Internal Revenue Service for Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions. For more information, see Social Security Numbers For Children (Publication No. 05-10023). 
What original documents do I need? 
Citizenship We can accept only certain documents as proof of U.S. citizenship. These include a U.S. birth certificate or U.S. passport. Age If your child has or can obtain a U.S .- State - Issued birth certificate that recorded his or her birth before age 5 , you must submit it. If not , we can consider other documents, such as your child's passport, to prove his or her age. Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview. We will ask for evidence to show that your child does not have a Social Security number. Here are examples of documents you can use to prove a Social Security number was never assigned : If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period , a current or previous passport , school and/or employment records , and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show that your child does not have a Social Security number. If your child has lived in the United States and is applying for an original Social Security number , we may ask you for information about the schools your child attended or we may ask you to provide copies of tax records that would show that your child was never assigned a Social Security number. Identity Your child : While you can use a birth certificate to prove age or citizenship , you cannot use it as proof of identity. Social Security needs evidence that shows the child continues to exist beyond the date of birth. We can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity. An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph. We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names. We prefer to see the child's U.S. passport. If that document is not available , we may accept the child's : State - issued non - driver's identification card ; Adoption decree ; Doctor, clinic or hospital record ; Religious record ; School daycare center record ; or School identification card. You : We also must see proof of your identity. An acceptable document must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph.

Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph : Employee identification card ; School identification card ; Health insurance card not a Medicare card ; or U.S. military identification card.

Full retirement age is the age at which a person may first become entitled to full or unreduced retirement benefits. No matter what your full retirement age also called " normal retirement age " is , you may start receiving benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70. 
If You Retire Early 
You can retire at any time between age 62 and full retirement age. However , if you start benefits early , your benefits are reduced a fraction of a percent for each month before your full retirement age. The chart below lists age 62 reduction amounts and includes examples based on an estimated monthly benefit of $1000 at full retirement age. Select your year of birth to find out how much your benefit will be reduced if you retire between age 62 and full retirement age. 
Full Retirement and Age 62 Benefit By Year Of Birth

The disadvantage is your benefit is reduced. Each person's situation is different. It is important to remember : if you delay your benefits until after full retirement age , you may be eligible for delayed retirement credits that would increase your monthly benefit ; that there are other things to consider when making the correct decision about your retirement benefits ; and to contact Social Security before you decide when to retire.

Getting Benefits While Working 
You can work while you receive Social Security retirement or survivors benefits. When you do , it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future. Each year we review the records for all working Social Security recipients. If your earnings for the prior year are higher than one of the years we used to compute your retirement benefit , we will recalculate your benefit amount. We pay the increase retroactive to January the year after you earned the money. Higher benefits can be important to you later in life and increase the future benefit amounts your family and your survivors could receive. 
How Much Can I Earn And Still Get Benefits? 
If you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit , your earnings may reduce your benefit amount. (Full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954. Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If you are under full retirement age for the entire year , we deduct $1 from your benefit payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit. For 2019 , that limit is $17,640.

Delayed Retirement Credits 
Social Security retirement benefits are increased by a certain percentage depending on date of birth if you delay your retirement beyond full retirement age. The benefit increase no longer applies when you reach age 70, even if you continue to delay taking benefits. 
Increase for Delayed Retirement 
If you've already reached full retirement age , you can choose to start receiving benefits before the month you apply. However , we cannot pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past. If you decide to delay your retirement , be sure to sign up for just Medicare at age 65. If you do not sign up , in some circumstances your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. If you do not sign up , in some circumstances your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more.

Benefits Planner: Retirement 

Other Things to Consider 
What Is The Best Age To Start Your Benefits? The answer is that there is no one " best age " for everyone and, ultimately, it is your choice. You should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances. Your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits. If you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time. at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time. The amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life. You may want to consider the following when you make that decision : If you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits. Depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits. If your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn. Reminders : After you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings. When additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit. If they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount. You can apply for just Medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later. When you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term. A man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years. A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. One out of 10 will live past age 95. How long do you expect to live? Did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s? If the answer is yes, and you have every reason to believe you will too , you may want to delay starting your benefits until full retirement age or later. If they didn't , you may choose to start receiving retirement benefits earlier. If you come from a long - lived family , you may need the extra money more in later years, particularly if you may outlive pensions or annuities with limits on how long they are paid. If you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier. If you stop working , not only will you lose your paycheck , but you may also lose valuable employer provided health insurance. Although there are exceptions , most people will not be covered by Medicare until they reach age 65. Your employer should be able to tell you if you will have retiree health benefits or if you can temporarily extend your health insurance coverage after you retire. Also , if you are married and your spouse is employed , you may be able to switch to their health insurance. 
Should I apply for Medicare? 
Remember , Medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. If you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact Social Security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for Medicare. Even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. If you need to sign up for Medicare but you do not , your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. Please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our Medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay. If you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : If you qualify for benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later. If you delay receiving your retirement benefit until your full retirement age or later , your retirement benefit will be higher. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached your full retirement age, and are eligible for a spouse s or divorced - spouse s benefit and your own retirement benefit , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If you file for one benefit , you will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you don't need your benefits immediately , you may decide to : Wait beyond full retirement age to receive delayed retirement credits. Reminder: If you are within 4 months of age 65, or older, and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. Choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them. Reminder: If you're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a Social Security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. The supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62. If your spouse or minor or disabled children will also qualify for benefits from your record , the value of their benefits, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner is your best choice. If your spouse or ex - spouse s date of birth is January 2 , 1954 or later and they become eligible to receive a higher benefit on your record while receiving retirement benefits , they can no longer delay filing for the additional benefit. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. However , when you start your retirement benefits also affects the amount your surviving spouse may receive. If you start your benefits : before full retirement age , we cannot pay your surviving spouse the full benefit amount from your record. Generally , if you were receiving reduced benefits , we base the survivors benefit on that amount. after full retirement age , your surviving spouse may receive your full benefit amount plus any accumulated delayed retirement credits. Accidents or unexpected changes in your circumstances can't be ruled out, of course , so your final decision may be based on your " best guess " about your future. 

title : Benefits Planner: Survivors | Planning For Your Survivors | Social Security Administration#2
document : As you plan for the future , you'll want to think about what your family would need if you should die now. Social Security can help your family if you have earned enough Social Security credits through your work. You can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When you have earned $5,440 , you have earned your four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for your survivors depends on your age when you die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to your children and your spouse who is caring for the children even if you don't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before your death. 
For Your Widow Or Widower 
There are about five million widows and widowers receiving monthly Social Security benefits based on their deceased spouse's earnings record. And , for many of those survivors, particularly aged women, those benefits are keeping them out of poverty. Widows and widowers can receive : reduced benefits as early as age 60 or full benefits at full retirement age or older. benefits as early as age 50 if they're disabled AND their disability started before or within seven years of your death. benefits at any age , if they have not remarried , and if they take care of your child who is under age 16 or disabled and receives benefits on your record. If applying for disability benefits on a deceased worker s record , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
For Your Surviving Divorced Spouse 
If you have a surviving divorced spouse , they could get the same benefits as your widow or widower provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amounts your other survivors will receive based on your earnings record. If your former spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on your record , they will not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your natural or legally adopted child. 
For Your Children 
Your unmarried children who are under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time can be eligible to receive Social Security benefits when you die. And your child can get benefits at any age if they were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides your natural children , your stepchildren, grandchildren, step grandchildren or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. For further information , view our publication. 
For Your Parents 
You must have been providing at least half of your parent s support and your parent must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your record. Generally, your parent also must not have married after your death ; however, there are some exceptions. In addition to your natural parent , your stepparent or adoptive parent may receive benefits if they became your parent before you were age 16. 
How Much Would Your Survivors Receive 
How much your family could receive in benefits depends on your average lifetime earnings. The higher your earnings were , the higher their benefits would be. We calculate a basic amount as if you had reached full retirement age at the time you die. These are examples of monthly benefit payments : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of your benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 to full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of your basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower , age 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Your dependent parent , age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death payment. 
Maximum Family Amount 
There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. Get your online or check our Benefit Calculators for an estimate of the benefits your family could receive if you died right now. 
Other Things You Need To Know 
There are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries before they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while they're married. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries after they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they will continue to qualify for benefits on your Social Security record. However , if their current spouse is a Social Security beneficiary , they may want to apply for spouse's benefits on their record. If that amount is more than the widow's or widower's benefit on your record , they will receive a combination of benefits that equals the higher amount. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse receives benefits on your record , they can switch to their own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes they're eligible for retirement benefits and their retirement rate is higher than their rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , their Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected.

If they qualify , your spouse or child may receive a monthly payment of up to one - half of your full retirement benefit amount. These payments will not decrease your retirement benefit.

Benefits Planner: Survivors | If You Are The Survivor 
Just as you plan for your family's protection if you die , you should consider the Social Security benefits that may be available if you are the survivor that is, the spouse, child, or parent of a worker who dies. That person must have worked long enough under Social Security to qualify for benefits. 
How Your Spouse Earns Social Security Survivors Benefits 
A worker can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440 , they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before their death. Each person s situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices. 
When A Family Member Dies 
We should be notified as soon as possible when a person dies. However , you cannot report a death or apply for survivors benefits online. If you need to report a death or apply for benefits , call 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 TTY 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. You can speak to a Social Security representative between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. You can also visit your local Social Security office. An appointment is not required , but if you call ahead and schedule one, it may reduce the time you spend waiting to speak to someone. 
Does Social Security pay death benefits? 
A one - time payment of $255 can be paid to the surviving spouse if he or she was living with the deceased; or, if living apart, was receiving certain Social Security benefits on the deceased s record. If there is no surviving spouse , the payment is made to a child who is eligible for benefits on the deceased s record in the month of death. 
What happens if the deceased received monthly benefits? 
If the deceased was receiving Social Security benefits , you must return the benefit received for the month of death and any later months. For example , if the person died in July , you must return the benefits paid in August. How you return the benefits depends on how the deceased received benefits : For funds received by direct deposit , contact the bank or other financial institution. Request that any funds received for the month of death or later be returned to Social Security. Benefits received by check must be returned to Social Security as soon as possible. Do not cash any checks received for the month in which the person dies or later. 
Who receives benefits? 
Certain family members may be eligible to receive monthly benefits, including : A widow or widower age 60 or older age 50 or older if disabled ; A surviving divorced spouse , under certain circumstances ; A widow or widower at any age who is caring for the deceased s child who is under age 16 or disabled and receiving benefits on their record ; An unmarried child of the deceased who is : Younger than age 18 or up to age 19 if he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or secondary school ; or Age 18 or older with a disability that began before age 22. 
Are other family members eligible? 
Under certain circumstances , the following family members may be eligible : A stepchild, grandchild, step grandchild, or adopted child ; and Parents , age 62 or older , who were dependent on the deceased for at least half of their support. 
Widow Or Widower 
If you are the widow or widower of a person who worked long enough under Social Security , you can : receive full benefits at full retirement age for survivors or reduced benefits as early as age 60. begin receiving benefits as early as age 50 if you are disabled and the disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. receive survivors benefits at any age , if you have not remarried and you take care of the deceased worker's child who is under age 16 or is disabled and receives benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , your remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. A widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse cannot apply online for survivors benefits. You should contact Social Security at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 to request an appointment. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number at 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. If you wish to apply for disability benefits as a survivor , you can speed up the disability application process if you complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of your appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
A few other situations: 
If you already receive benefits as a spouse , your benefit will automatically convert to survivors benefits after we receive the report of death. If you are also eligible for retirement benefits but haven't applied yet , you have an additional option. You can apply for retirement or survivors benefits now and switch to the other higher benefit at a later date. For those already receiving retirement benefits , you can only apply for benefits as a widow or widower if the retirement benefit you receive is less than the benefits you would receive as a survivor. 
Surviving Divorced Spouse 
If you are the divorced spouse of a worker who dies , you could get benefits the same as a widow or widower, provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to you as a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amount for other survivors getting benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , the remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. If you are caring for a child under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on the record of your former spouse , you would not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your former spouse's natural or legally adopted child. 
Minor Or Disabled Child 
If you are the unmarried child under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time of a worker who dies , you can be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. And you can get benefits at any age if you were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides the worker's natural children , their stepchildren, grandchildren, or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. 
For Your Parents 
If you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions. Besides being the natural parent , you could also be the stepparent, or the adoptive parent if you became the deceased worker s parent before he or she was age 16. 
Survivors Benefit Amount 
Your survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death benefit. 
Maximum Family Amount 
There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. 
Other Things You Need To Know 
There are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected. 
A Special Lump-Sum Death Payment 
A surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump - sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Generally , the lump - sum is paid to the surviving spouse who was living in the same household as the worker when they died. If they were living apart , the surviving spouse can still receive the lump - sum if, during the month the worker died, they : were already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If there's no eligible surviving spouse , the lump - sum can be paid to the worker's child or children if, during the month the worker died, the child : was already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If the eligible surviving spouse or child is not currently receiving benefits , they must apply for this payment within two years of the date of death.

Medicare Premiums: Rules For Higher-Income Beneficiaries 
The law requires an adjustment to your monthly Medicare Part B medical insurance and Medicare prescription drug coverage premiums. This affects less than five percent of people with Medicare. Most people don t pay higher premiums. 
If You Have a Higher Income 
If you have higher income , you ll pay an additional premium amount for Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. We call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount. Here s how it works : Part B helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care. It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs. If you re a higher - income beneficiary with Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount, which is based on what you report to the IRS. Because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium. We tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium, not your own premium amount. If you re a higher - income beneficiary , we deduct this amount from your monthly Social Security payments regardless of how you usually pay your monthly prescription plan premiums. If the amount is greater than your monthly payment from Social Security, or you don t get monthly payments , you ll get a separate bill from another federal agency, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Railroad Retirement Board. 
How Social Security Determines You Have a Higher Premium 
Social Security uses the most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. If you must pay higher premiums , we use a sliding scale to calculate the adjustments, based on your modified adjusted gross income MAGI. Your MAGI is your total adjusted gross income and tax - exempt interest income. If you file your taxes as married, filing jointly and your MAGI is greater than $170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you file your taxes using a different status, and your MAGI is greater than $85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums. See the chart below, Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI, for an idea of what you can expect to pay. If you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination. If you have both Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each. If you have only one Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have. If you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year, and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll. In this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination. Remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you. 
Your Tax Return 
To determine your 2020 income - related monthly adjustment amounts , we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. Generally , this information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes , the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017. If we use the 2017 tax year data , and you filed a return for tax year 2018 or did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2018 , call us or visit any local Social Security office. We ll update our records. If you amended your tax return , we count and it changes the income to determine the income - related monthly adjustment amounts your MAGI , let us know. Social Security needs to see a copy of the amended tax return you filed and your acknowledgment receipt from IRS. We ll update our records with the information you provide, and correct or remove your income - related monthly adjustment amounts, as appropriate. 
If Your Income Has Gone Down 
If your income has gone down due to any of the following situations, and the change makes a difference in the income level we consider , contact us to explain that you have new information and may need a new decision about your income - related monthly adjustment amount : You married, divorced, or became widowed. You or your spouse stopped working or reduced your work hours. You or your spouse lost income - producing property because of a disaster or other event beyond your control. You or your spouse experienced a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer s pension plan. You or your spouse received a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer s closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization. If any of the above applies to you , we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar. If you filed a federal income tax return for the year in question , you need to show us your signed copy of the return. Use Form Medicare Income - Related Monthly Adjustment Amount Life - Changing Event to report a major life - changing event. If your income has gone down , you may also use Form SSA-44 to request a reduction in your income - related monthly adjustment amount. You can find Form SSA-44. 
Monthly Medicare premiums for 2020 
The standard Part B premium for 2020 is $144.60. If you re single and filed an individual tax return, or married and filed a joint tax return , the following chart applies to you : If you re married and lived with your spouse at some time during the taxable year, but filed a separate tax return , the following chart applies to you :

Benefits Planner: Survivors | Planning For Your Survivors 
As you plan for the future , you'll want to think about what your family would need if you should die now. Social Security can help your family if you have earned enough Social Security credits through your work. You can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When you have earned $5,440 , you have earned your four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for your survivors depends on your age when you die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to your children and your spouse who is caring for the children even if you don't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before your death. 
For Your Widow Or Widower 
There are about five million widows and widowers receiving monthly Social Security benefits based on their deceased spouse's earnings record. And , for many of those survivors, particularly aged women, those benefits are keeping them out of poverty. Widows and widowers can receive : reduced benefits as early as age 60 or full benefits at full retirement age or older. benefits as early as age 50 if they're disabled AND their disability started before or within seven years of your death. benefits at any age , if they have not remarried , and if they take care of your child who is under age 16 or disabled and receives benefits on your record. If applying for disability benefits on a deceased worker s record , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
For Your Surviving Divorced Spouse 
If you have a surviving divorced spouse , they could get the same benefits as your widow or widower provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amounts your other survivors will receive based on your earnings record. If your former spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on your record , they will not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your natural or legally adopted child. 
For Your Children 
Your unmarried children who are under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time can be eligible to receive Social Security benefits when you die. And your child can get benefits at any age if they were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides your natural children , your stepchildren, grandchildren, step grandchildren or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. For further information , view our publication. 
For Your Parents 
You must have been providing at least half of your parent s support and your parent must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your record. Generally, your parent also must not have married after your death ; however, there are some exceptions. In addition to your natural parent , your stepparent or adoptive parent may receive benefits if they became your parent before you were age 16. 
How Much Would Your Survivors Receive 
How much your family could receive in benefits depends on your average lifetime earnings. The higher your earnings were , the higher their benefits would be. We calculate a basic amount as if you had reached full retirement age at the time you die. These are examples of monthly benefit payments : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of your benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 to full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of your basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower , age 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Your dependent parent , age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death payment. 
Maximum Family Amount 
There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. Get your online or check our Benefit Calculators for an estimate of the benefits your family could receive if you died right now. 
Other Things You Need To Know 
There are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries before they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while they're married. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse remarries after they reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , they will continue to qualify for benefits on your Social Security record. However , if their current spouse is a Social Security beneficiary , they may want to apply for spouse's benefits on their record. If that amount is more than the widow's or widower's benefit on your record , they will receive a combination of benefits that equals the higher amount. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse receives benefits on your record , they can switch to their own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes they're eligible for retirement benefits and their retirement rate is higher than their rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If your widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , their Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected.

title : Benefits Planner: Disability | How You Qualify | Social Security Administration#2
document : To qualify for Social Security disability benefits , you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general , we pay monthly benefits to people who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability. Benefits usually continue until you are able to work again on a regular basis. There are also a number of special rules, called " work incentives, " that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work. If you are receiving Social Security disability benefits when you reach full retirement age, your disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits , but the amount remains the same. 
How Much Work Do You Need? 
In addition to meeting our definition of disability , you must have worked long enough and recently enough under Social Security to qualify for disability benefits. Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self - employment income. You can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 in wages or self - employment income. When you've earned $5,440 , you've earned your four credits for the year. The number of work credits you need to qualify for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally , you need 40 credits , 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However , younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information on whether you qualify , read our publication ; How You Earn Credits. 
What We Mean By Disability 
The definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. 
How We Decide If You Are Disabled 
If you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: 
1. Are you working? 
If you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. 
2. Is your condition "severe"? 
Your condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3. 
3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? 
For each of the major body systems , we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list , we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is , we will find that you are disabled. If it is not , we then go to Step 4. We have two initiatives designed to expedite our processing of new disability claims : Compassionate Allowances : Certain cases that usually qualify for disability can be allowed as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Examples include acute leukemia, Lou Gehrig s disease ALS, and pancreatic cancer. Quick Disability Determinations : We use sophisticated computer screening to identify cases with a high probability of allowance. For more information about our disability claims process , visit our Benefits For People With Disabilities website. 
4. Can you do the work you did previously? 
At this step , we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work. It is doesn t, we ll decide you don t have a qualifying disability. If it does , we proceed to Step 5. 
5. Can you do any other type of work? 
If you can t do the work you did in the past , we look to see if there is other work you could do despite your impairment. We consider your medical conditions and your age, education, past work experience, and any transferable skills you may have. If you can t do other work , we ll decide you are disabled. If you can do other work , we ll decide that you don t have a qualifying disability and your claim will be denied. 
Special Situations 
Most people who receive disability benefits are workers who qualify on their own records and meet the work and disability requirements we have just described. However , there are some situations you may not know about : If You're Blind Or Have Low Vision - How We Can Help If You Are The Worker's Widow Or Widower Benefits For A Disabled Child Benefits for Wounded Warriors & Veterans 
Special Rules For People Who Are Blind Or Have Low Vision 
We consider you to be legally blind under Social Security rules if your vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in your better eye or if your visual field is 20 degrees or less, even with a corrective lens. Many people who meet the legal definition of blindness still have some sight and may be able to read large print and get around without a cane or a guide dog. If you do not meet the legal definition of blindness , you may still qualify for disability benefits if your vision problems alone or combined with other health problems prevent you from working. There are a number of special rules for people who are blind that recognize the severe impact of blindness on a person's ability to work. For example , the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit that applies to non - blind disabled workers. In 2019 , the monthly earnings limit is $2,040. 
Benefits For Disabled Widows Or Widowers 
If something happens to a worker , benefits may be payable to their widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse with a disability if the following conditions are met : He or she is between ages 50 and 60 ; Their condition meets the definition of disability for adults ; and The disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. Widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses cannot apply online for survivors benefits. However , if they want to apply for benefits , they should contact Social Security immediatelyat to request an appointment. (If they are deaf or hard of hearing, they should call our TTY number at If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
Benefits For A Disabled Child 
A child under age 18 may be disabled , but we don't need to consider the child's disability when deciding if he or she qualifies for benefits as your dependent. The child's benefits normally stop at age 18 unless he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or high school benefits can continue until age 19 or is disabled. 
Adults Disabled Before Age 22 
An adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a " child's " benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The " adult child " including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider " substantial " increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. 
What if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? 
An adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. 
How do we decide if an adult "child" is disabled for SSDI benefits? 
If a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us. 
What happens if the adult child gets married? 
If he or she receives benefits as an adult disabled since childhood , the benefits generally end if he or she gets married. However , some marriages for example, to another adult disabled child are considered protected. The rules vary depending on the situation. Contact a Social Security representative at (If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call TTY number at to find out if the benefits can continue. If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment.

Benefits For Your Spouse 
Even if you have never worked under Social Security , you may be able to get spouse s retirement benefits if you are at least 62 years of age and your spouse is receiving retirement or disability benefits. You can also qualify for Medicare at age 65. If you are divorced , you may still be able to get benefits on your ex - spouse's record. For information on the requirements for Divorced Spouse's Benefits , read " If You Are Divorced You can receive the spouse's benefit no matter what your age is if you are caring for their child who is also receiving benefits. 
How Much Will I Receive? 
If you qualify and apply for your own retirement benefits and for benefits as a spouse , we always pay your own benefits first. If your benefits as a spouse are higher than your own retirement benefits , you will get a combination of benefits equaling the higher spouse benefit. If you begin receiving benefits : between age 62 and your full retirement age , the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to your full retirement age. If you are under full retirement age and you continue to work while receiving benefits , your benefits may be affected by the retirement earnings test. at your full retirement age , your benefit as a spouse cannot exceed one - half of your spouse's full retirement amount. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached full retirement age , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your spouse is full retirement age and applying for spouse s benefits only , they can apply online by using the retirement application. Your spouse can also contact us to schedule an appointment. If your spouse s birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you will receive a pension for work not covered by Social Security such as government employment , the amount of your Social Security benefits on your spouse's record may be reduced. Benefits paid to you as a spouse will not decrease your spouse s retirement benefit. In fact , the value of the benefits you may receive, added to their benefits, may help your spouse decide if taking benefits sooner may be more advantageous. 
Maximum Family Benefits 
If one of your spouse's children also qualifies for benefits , there is a limit to the amount we can pay family members. The total depends on your spouse's benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on the same record. The total varies , but generally the total amount the worker your spouse and their family members can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of the worker's full retirement benefit. 
How Do I Apply?

Benefits Planner: Disability | You're Approved 

When Your Benefits Start 
If your application is approved , your first Social Security benefit will be paid for the sixth full month after the date we find that your disability began. For example , if your disability began on June 15 , 2018 , your first benefit would be paid for the month of December 2018, the sixth full month of disability. Social Security benefits are paid in the month following the month for which they're due. This means that the benefit due for December would be paid to you in January 2019, and so on. 
How Much You Will Receive 
The amount of your monthly disability benefit is based on your lifetime average earnings covered by Social Security. If you don't already have an estimate , you can get your online with your personal my Social Security account or use our Benefit Calculators to determine how much you would get if you became disabled right now. 
Other Payments May Affect Your Disability Benefits 
If you receive certain other government benefits, such as workers' compensation, public disability benefits, or pensions based on work not covered by Social Security for example, some government or foreign employment, the Social Security benefits payable to you and your family may be reduced. For more information about how these benefits can affect your Social Security payments , refer to the following publications : How Workers' Compensation And Other Disability Payments May Affect Your Benefit ; Windfall Elimination Provision ; or Government Pension Offset. Related Information Income Taxes And Your Social Security Benefits. 
Medicare Coverage If You're Disabled 
We automatically enroll you in Medicare after you get disability benefits for two years. The two parts of Medicare we enroll you in are hospital insurance and medical insurance. Hospital insurance Part A helps pay for inpatient hospital bills and some follow - up care. The taxes you paid while you were working financed this coverage , so it is provided at no cost to you. Medical insurance Part B helps pay doctors' bills, outpatient hospital care, and other medical services. You will need to pay a monthly premium for this coverage if you want it. Most people have both parts of Medicare. If you have questions about this coverage , you can contact Medicare toll - free at to speak to a Medicare Customer Service Representative. TTY users should call 
The Other Parts of Medicare 
Medicare Advantage Part C. People with Medicare Parts A and Part B can choose to receive all of their health care services through plans that are offered by private companies and approved by Medicare. For more information , we recommend you read Medicare 's Prescription Drug Coverage Part D helps pay for medications doctors prescribe for treatment. For more information on the enrollment periods for Part D , we recommend you read Medicare's page. If you receive Medicare and have limited resources and income , you may be eligible for Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Costs. 
Help For Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries 
If you get Medicare and have low - income and few resources , your state may pay your Medicare premiums and, in some cases, other Medicare costs for which you are normally responsible such as deductibles and coinsurance. Only your state can decide if you qualify for this assistance. To find out if you do , contact your state or local welfare office or Medicaid agency.

document : 
Original Card for a Foreign Born U.S. Citizen Child 
Important You must present original documents or copies certified by the agency that issued them. We cannot accept photocopies or notarized copies. All documents must be current not expired. We cannot accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. 
What original documents do I need? 
Citizenship We can accept only certain documents as proof of U.S. citizenship. These include : Certification of Report of Birth DS-1350 ; Consular Report of Birth Abroad FS-240 ; U.S. passport ; Certificate of Citizenship N-560/N-561 ; Certificate of Naturalization N-550/N-570. Age You must present your child's foreign birth certificate if you have it or can get it within 10 days. If not , we will consider other documents such as your child's passport or a document issued by DHS as evidence of your child's age. Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview. We will ask for evidence so we can check our records that we have not already issued a Social Security card to your child. Here are examples of documents that we may need to see : If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period , a current or previous passport , school and/or employment records , and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States. If your child has lived in the United States information about the schools your child attended , and copies of tax records. Identity Your child : We can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity. An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph. We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names. We prefer to see the child's U.S. passport. If that document is not available , we may accept the child's : State - issued non - driver's identification card ; Adoption decree ; Doctor, clinic or hospital record ; Religious record ; School daycare center record ; or School identification card. You : We also must see proof of your identity. An acceptable document must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph. For example , as proof of identity Social Security must see your : U.S. driver's license ; State - issued non - driver identification card ; or U.S. passport. If you do not have one of these specific documents or you cannot get a replacement for one of them within 10 days , we will ask to see other documents. Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph : Employee identification card ; School identification card ; Health insurance card not a Medicare card ; or U.S. military identification card. Note We may use one document for two purposes. For example , we may use your U.S. passport as proof of both citizenship and identity. However , you must provide at least two separate documents.

Benefits Planner: Disability 
Disability is a subject you may read about in the newspaper, but not think of as something that might actually happen to you. But your chances of becoming disabled are probably greater than you realize. Studies show that just over one in four of today's 20-year - olds will become disabled before reaching age 67. While we spend a lot of time working to succeed in our jobs and careers , few of us think about ensuring that we have a safety net to fall back on should we become disabled. This is an area where Social Security can provide valuable help to you. This disability planner helps you find out : how you can qualify and apply for benefits ; what happens if your application is approved ; who can receive benefits on your earnings record ; what you need to know about receiving disability benefits ; when Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries ; and what happens if you go back to work. 
Disability and Supplemental Security Income 
We pay disability benefits under two programs : The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22. The Supplemental Security Income SSI program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources. For most people , the medical requirements are the same under both programs and disability is determined by the same process. Whether you apply for Social Security disability or SSI , we ask you for information about your medical condition, work, and education history to help us decide if you are disabled under our rules. Additional information about SSI can be found at " What Is Supplemental Security Income? "

You must still sign in with your username, password, and a unique security code we will provide each time you sign in. 
Internet Phishing Alert 
Internet scam artists use clever phishing schemes to defraud millions of people each year. Phishing is the practice of using social engineering techniques over email to trick a recipient into revealing personal information, clicking on a malicious link, or opening a malicious attachment. 
How can I detect a phishing email pretending to be Social Security? 
Most emails from Social Security will come from a .gov " email address. If an email address does not end in .gov , use caution before opening attachments or clicking on pictures or links in the email. Currently , Social Security sends emails from no-reply@ssa.gov, subscription.service@subscriptions.ssa.gov and ThankYou@ssa.gov. In a few instances , we use marketing firms to raise awareness of Social Security s online services , and this includes creating a my Social Security account. We allow these firms to send email directly to individuals. Any links you find within these emails should always point to a .gov/ web address. Links, logos, or pictures in the body of an official Social Security email will always direct you to an official Social Security website. Rather than relying on the way a link looks , please follow these steps to confirm a link s authenticity : To verify the web address of a link or picture , hover over it with your mouse until a text box appears with the web address. This is the actual address you will be directed to and it should always end in .gov/ A forward slash should always follow the .gov domain. Example - https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ Links to the official Social Security website will always begin with https://www.socialsecurity.gov/ or https://secure.ssa.gov/. Below are examples of fraudulent websites pretending to direct you to Social Security. Noticethe location of the forward slash. https://www.socialsecurity.gov.gmx.de/ http://www.socialsecurity.gov.bx.co.rx/setup 
What should I do if I ve received a phishing email pretending to be from Social Security? 
If you are not certain that an e - mail you received came from Social Security or one of our marketing firms , DO NOT respond to the email or click on any links contained in the email message. Report the incident by forwarding the suspicious email to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team US - CERT at phishing-report@us-cert.gov. http://www.us-nocert.gov/nav/report_phishing.html. 
What are other tips I can use for detecting phishing emails? 
Verify the sender. Exercise caution when receiving email from a sender you don t know or haven t heard from in a long time. Hover over the From email address to ensure it matches the displayed email or name of the sender. Look for poor choices in wording, phrasing, or spelling. If an email includes a business name, telephone number, or website link , verify the legitimacy of these items by searching for the official number or website in a search engine. Do not respond to emails requesting personal information. Reputable businesses and public agencies will not ask you for personal information in an email. 
Are there other resources I can use to learn more about phishing?

title : Benefits Planner: Retirement | Government Pension Offset (GPO) Calculator | Social Security Administration#1
document : 
Benefits Planner: Retirement 

What is Government Pension Offset (GPO)? 
If you will receive a pension for work not covered by Social Security such as government employment , any Social Security benefits you may be eligible to receive on your spouse's record may be reduced. This type of benefit reduction is called GPO. Some individuals are exempt from the offset. If you want to know if you meet the requirements for an exemption , please read the " When won't my Social Security benefits be reduced? " section of our " Government Pension Offset " factsheet. 
Information You Need to Calculate Your Benefits If You Are Affected by the GPO 
To estimate your future spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefits under the GPO , you need two things : The estimated " gross " monthly amount of your pension from your government job not covered by Social Security. The estimated monthly amount of your Social Security benefit as a spouse, widow, or widower before the effect of GPO. 
If you will be eligible for spouse's benefits and have access to your spouse's estimate: 
Find the estimated amount of the retirement benefit your spouse would be eligible to receive at full retirement age. If your spouse already receives benefits , ask them what their benefit would be if it started at their full or normal retirement age. Divide this amount in half and round down to the nearest dollar. This is your estimated spouse's benefit if you retire at full retirement age. 
If you will be eligible for a Social Security retirement benefit based on your own earnings: 
As well as a higher benefit based on your spouse's earnings , it will also affect your benefits as a spouse, widow, or widower. To get a more accurate estimate of how the government pension you will receive for work not covered by Social Security will affect the part of your benefit based on your spouse's work : Enter the estimated " gross " monthly amount of the government pension in today's dollars you will receive for work not covered by Social Security in Step #1 of " Calculate Your Benefits. " Use your most recent estimate to determine your estimated retirement benefit based on your own earnings. Subtract the estimated amount of your retirement benefit from the estimated amount of your spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit before GPO. Enter that amount in Step #2 of " Calculate Your Benefits " and select " Compute. " The amount in #3 of " Calculate Your Benefits " is your estimated spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit after GPO is applied. Add that figure to the estimated amount of your retirement benefit to find your total estimated monthly benefit. 
If you retire before full retirement age: 
Your benefit amount as a spouse will be reduced. (The reduction will vary based on your date of birth. The maximum reduction for benefits starting at age 62 is 30 percent for someone born in 1946. It will increase to 35 percent for those born in 1960 or later.) For more information about your estimated benefit amount if you retire before reaching full retirement age , please call our toll free number at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number at 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778 or contact your local Social Security office.

How Retirement Benefits Work 
Social Security replaces a percentage of a worker s pre - retirement income based on their lifetime earnings. The portion of your pre - retirement wages that Social Security replaces is based on your highest 35 years of earnings and varies depending on how much you earn and when you choose to start benefits. The Social Security system works like this : when you work, you pay taxes into Social Security. We use the tax money to pay benefits to : People who have already retired. People who are disabled. Survivors of workers who have died. Dependents of beneficiaries. The money you pay in taxes isn t held in a personal account for you to use when you get benefits. We use your taxes to pay people who are getting benefits right now. Any unused money goes to a Social Security trust fund that pays monthly benefits to you and your family when you start receiving retirement benefits.

Planning For Retirement 
Planning is the key to creating your best retirement. You ll need to plan and save for years to achieve your retirement goals. While many factors affect retirement planning , we want you to understand what Social Security can mean to you and your family s financial future. 
Social Security Should Be Just One Part Of Your Retirement Plan 
On average , retirement beneficiaries receive 40% of their pre - retirement income from Social Security. As you make your retirement plan , knowing the approximate amount you will receive in Social Security benefits can help you determine how much other retirement income you ll need to reach your goals. 
Are You Eligible? 
When you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn credits toward Social Security benefits. The number of credits you need to get retirement benefits depends on when you were born. If you were born in 1929 or later , you need 40 credits usually, this is 10 years of work. If you stop working before you have enough credits to qualify for benefits , the credits will remain on your Social Security record. If you return to work later , more credits may be added. We can t pay any retirement benefits until you have 40 credits. Our retirement planner has additional details on how Social Security Credits work. 
Verify Your Earnings History 
The amount of the Social Security benefits you or your family receives depends on the amount of earnings shown on your record. Regularly checking your Social Security earnings history can help ensure there are no surprises when it s time for you to start receiving benefits.

Deciding When To Start Retirement Benefits 
Choosing when to start receiving retirement benefits is a personal decision. If you choose to retire begin receiving benefits when you reach your full retirement age , you ll receive your full benefit amount. We will reduce your benefit amount if you retire start benefits before reaching full retirement age. To make an informed choice , consider the following factors as you think about when to start your Social Security benefits. 
What Age Should You Start To Receive Benefits? 
The age you begin collecting your retirement benefit affects how much you will receive. There are three important things to know about age when thinking about when to start your benefits. 
Full Retirement Age 
Full retirement age is the age when you will be able to collect your full retirement benefit amount. The full retirement age is 66 if you were born from 1943 to 1954. The full retirement age increases gradually if you were born from 1955 to 1960, until it reaches 67. For anyone born 1960 or later , full retirement benefits are payable at age 67. You can find your full retirement age by birth year in the full retirement age chart. 
Early Retirement Age 
You can get Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. However , your benefit is reduced if you start receiving benefits before your full retirement age. Understand how claiming retirement benefits early will affect your benefit amount. 
Delayed Retirement Age 
When you delay collecting benefits beyond your full retirement age , the amount of your retirement benefit will continue to increase up until age 70. There is no incentive to delay claiming after age 70.

What Else Affects Your Retirement Benefits 
Everyone s retirement is unique. Beyond deciding when to begin receiving retirement benefits , other factors that can affect your benefits include whether you continue to work, what type of job you had, and if you have a pension from certain jobs. 
Continuing To Work 
You can choose to keep working beyond your full retirement age. If you do , you can increase your future Social Security benefits. Each extra year you work adds another year of earnings to your Social Security record. Higher lifetime earnings can mean higher benefits when you choose to receive benefits. 
Specific Types Of Earnings 
While Social Security earnings are calculated the same way for most American workers , there are some types of earnings that have additional rules. Earning types with special rules include : Farm Work Federal Government Employment Household Employment Military Service Nonprofit Or Religious Organizations Railroad Earnings Self-Employment State And Local Government Employment Wages Work Outside The United States 
Pensions And Other Factors 
Pensions and taxes have the potential to impact your retirement benefit. Review the resources below on pensions and other factors you should consider : Windfall Elimination Provision WEP : If you have a pension from a job for which you didn t pay Social Security taxes, this policy may lower your retirement benefits. Government Pension Offset GPO : This policy affects benefits as a spouse, widow, or widower if you have a pension from a government job for which you didn t pay Social Security taxes. Income Taxes And Your Social Security Benefits : You might have to pay federal income taxes on your Social Security benefits in certain situations.

Benefits Planner: Disability | How You Qualify 
To qualify for Social Security disability benefits , you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general , we pay monthly benefits to people who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability. Benefits usually continue until you are able to work again on a regular basis. There are also a number of special rules, called " work incentives, " that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work. If you are receiving Social Security disability benefits when you reach full retirement age, your disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits , but the amount remains the same. 
How Much Work Do You Need? 
In addition to meeting our definition of disability , you must have worked long enough and recently enough under Social Security to qualify for disability benefits. Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self - employment income. You can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 in wages or self - employment income. When you've earned $5,440 , you've earned your four credits for the year. The number of work credits you need to qualify for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally , you need 40 credits , 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However , younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information on whether you qualify , read our publication ; How You Earn Credits. 
What We Mean By Disability 
The definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. 
How We Decide If You Are Disabled 
If you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: 
1. Are you working? 
If you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. 
2. Is your condition "severe"? 
Your condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3. 
3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? 
For each of the major body systems , we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list , we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is , we will find that you are disabled. If it is not , we then go to Step 4. We have two initiatives designed to expedite our processing of new disability claims : Compassionate Allowances : Certain cases that usually qualify for disability can be allowed as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Examples include acute leukemia, Lou Gehrig s disease ALS, and pancreatic cancer. Quick Disability Determinations : We use sophisticated computer screening to identify cases with a high probability of allowance. For more information about our disability claims process , visit our Benefits For People With Disabilities website. 
4. Can you do the work you did previously? 
At this step , we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work. It is doesn t, we ll decide you don t have a qualifying disability. If it does , we proceed to Step 5. 
5. Can you do any other type of work? 
If you can t do the work you did in the past , we look to see if there is other work you could do despite your impairment. We consider your medical conditions and your age, education, past work experience, and any transferable skills you may have. If you can t do other work , we ll decide you are disabled. If you can do other work , we ll decide that you don t have a qualifying disability and your claim will be denied. 
Special Situations 
Most people who receive disability benefits are workers who qualify on their own records and meet the work and disability requirements we have just described. However , there are some situations you may not know about : If You're Blind Or Have Low Vision - How We Can Help If You Are The Worker's Widow Or Widower Benefits For A Disabled Child Benefits for Wounded Warriors & Veterans 
Special Rules For People Who Are Blind Or Have Low Vision 
We consider you to be legally blind under Social Security rules if your vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in your better eye or if your visual field is 20 degrees or less, even with a corrective lens. Many people who meet the legal definition of blindness still have some sight and may be able to read large print and get around without a cane or a guide dog. If you do not meet the legal definition of blindness , you may still qualify for disability benefits if your vision problems alone or combined with other health problems prevent you from working. There are a number of special rules for people who are blind that recognize the severe impact of blindness on a person's ability to work. For example , the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit that applies to non - blind disabled workers. In 2019 , the monthly earnings limit is $2,040. 
Benefits For Disabled Widows Or Widowers 
If something happens to a worker , benefits may be payable to their widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse with a disability if the following conditions are met : He or she is between ages 50 and 60 ; Their condition meets the definition of disability for adults ; and The disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. Widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses cannot apply online for survivors benefits. However , if they want to apply for benefits , they should contact Social Security immediatelyat to request an appointment. (If they are deaf or hard of hearing, they should call our TTY number at If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
Benefits For A Disabled Child 
A child under age 18 may be disabled , but we don't need to consider the child's disability when deciding if he or she qualifies for benefits as your dependent. The child's benefits normally stop at age 18 unless he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or high school benefits can continue until age 19 or is disabled. 
Adults Disabled Before Age 22 
An adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a " child's " benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The " adult child " including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider " substantial " increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. 
What if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? 
An adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. 
How do we decide if an adult "child" is disabled for SSDI benefits? 
If a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us. 
What happens if the adult child gets married? 
If he or she receives benefits as an adult disabled since childhood , the benefits generally end if he or she gets married. However , some marriages for example, to another adult disabled child are considered protected. The rules vary depending on the situation. Contact a Social Security representative at (If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call TTY number at to find out if the benefits can continue. If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment.

title : Retirement Estimator | Social Security Administration#2
document : 
How the Retirement Estimator Works 
The Retirement Estimator gives estimates based on your actual Social Security earnings record. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates. Estimate Your Retirement Benefits We can t provide your actual benefit amount until you apply for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates provided because : Your earnings may increase or decrease in the future. After you start receiving benefits , they will be adjusted for cost - of - living increases. Your estimated benefits are based on current law. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2035, the combined trust fund reserves are projected to become depleted one year later than projected last year. Payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 80 cents for each dollar of scheduled benefits. Your benefit amount may be affected by military service, railroad employment or pensions earned through work on which you did not pay Social Security tax. 
Who Can Use the Retirement Estimator 
You can use the Retirement Estimator if : You have enough Social Security credits at this time to qualify for benefits and You are not : Currently receiving benefits on your own Social Security record ; Waiting for a decision about your application for benefits or Medicare ; Age 62 or older and receiving benefits on another Social Security record ; or Eligible for a Pension Based on Work Not Covered By Social Security. If you are currently receiving only Medicare benefits , you can still get an estimate. For more information go to this link for our publication Retirement Information For Medicare Beneficiaries. If you cannot use the Retirement Estimator or you want a survivors or disability benefit estimate , please use one of our other benefit Calculators.

title : Benefits Planner | Social Security Credits and Benefit Eligibility | SSA#2
document : 
Social Security Credits 
You must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes. The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive. It only determines if you are eligible or not. You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits. We cannot pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits. We use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits, as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die. 
How Credits Are Earned 
Since 1978 , when you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year. Credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year. You might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time. The amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year. In 2020 , you earn one Social Security or Medicare credit for every $1,410 in covered earnings each year. You must earn $5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year. During your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits. These extra credits do not increase your benefit amount. The average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits. Read our publication, " How You Earn Credits, " for more information. 
Number Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits 
If you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement. 
Number Of Credits Needed For Disability Benefits 
To be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test. The number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age. The rules are as follows : Before age 24 - You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts. Age 24 to 31 In general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled. As a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. Age 31 or older - In general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled. The following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began. For the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period. The table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need. It does not cover all situations. If you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test. When statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement. NOTE : This table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations 
Number Of Credits Needed For Survivors Benefits 
The number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die. The younger you are , the fewer credits needed. Nobody needs more than 40 credits. Under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children, even if your record doesn't have the number of credits needed. They can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year's work 6 credits in the three years before your death. If you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement. We will not have to determine your credits again.

Maximum Family Amount 
Each family member may be eligible for a monthly benefit of up to 50 percent of your disability benefit amount. However , there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family.

Applying for Medicare Only 
If you are within three months of age 65 or older and not ready to start your monthly Social Security benefits yet , you can use our online retirement application to sign up just for Medicare and wait to apply for your retirement or spouses benefits later. Before you decide , you need to be sure that you understand how waiting until later will affect : the lifetime benefits we can pay on your account and your health insurance coverage. 
Lifetime Benefits We Can Pay On Your Record 
You can start your retirement benefit at any point from age 62 up until age 70. Your benefit amountwill be higher the longer you delay starting it. This adjustment is usually permanent. If you: Apply for benefits before full retirement age , your benefitswill be reduced because you are taking them earlier. (Full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954. Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If your full retirement age is 66 and you decideto start your retirement benefits at age 65 , your benefit will be 93.33 percent of yourfull benefit amount. Delay receiving retirement benefits until after you reach full retirementage any month up to age 70 , you can increase your benefit by accumulating Delayed Retirement Credits. If your full retirement age is 66 and 2 months and you wait until age 70 , your benefitwill be 130.67 percent of your full retirement age benefit. Have family members who qualify for benefits, a delay meansyou would lose some of the benefits they might have received. However , delaying benefitsalso increases the maximum monthly survivors benefit your spouse may receive. 
If You Plan To Continue Working 
Even if you plan to continue working , you may still be able to receive some benefits. If you areunder full retirement age and you earn over a certain amount , we will deduct the excess earnings from your benefits.

title : Benefits Planner: Survivors | If You Are The Survivor | Social Security Administration#2
document : Just as you plan for your family's protection if you die , you should consider the Social Security benefits that may be available if you are the survivor that is, the spouse, child, or parent of a worker who dies. That person must have worked long enough under Social Security to qualify for benefits. 
How Your Spouse Earns Social Security Survivors Benefits 
A worker can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440 , they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before their death. Each person s situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices. 
When A Family Member Dies 
We should be notified as soon as possible when a person dies. However , you cannot report a death or apply for survivors benefits online. If you need to report a death or apply for benefits , call 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 TTY 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. You can speak to a Social Security representative between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. You can also visit your local Social Security office. An appointment is not required , but if you call ahead and schedule one, it may reduce the time you spend waiting to speak to someone. 
Does Social Security pay death benefits? 
A one - time payment of $255 can be paid to the surviving spouse if he or she was living with the deceased; or, if living apart, was receiving certain Social Security benefits on the deceased s record. If there is no surviving spouse , the payment is made to a child who is eligible for benefits on the deceased s record in the month of death. 
What happens if the deceased received monthly benefits? 
If the deceased was receiving Social Security benefits , you must return the benefit received for the month of death and any later months. For example , if the person died in July , you must return the benefits paid in August. How you return the benefits depends on how the deceased received benefits : For funds received by direct deposit , contact the bank or other financial institution. Request that any funds received for the month of death or later be returned to Social Security. Benefits received by check must be returned to Social Security as soon as possible. Do not cash any checks received for the month in which the person dies or later. 
Who receives benefits? 
Certain family members may be eligible to receive monthly benefits, including : A widow or widower age 60 or older age 50 or older if disabled ; A surviving divorced spouse , under certain circumstances ; A widow or widower at any age who is caring for the deceased s child who is under age 16 or disabled and receiving benefits on their record ; An unmarried child of the deceased who is : Younger than age 18 or up to age 19 if he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or secondary school ; or Age 18 or older with a disability that began before age 22. 
Are other family members eligible? 
Under certain circumstances , the following family members may be eligible : A stepchild, grandchild, step grandchild, or adopted child ; and Parents , age 62 or older , who were dependent on the deceased for at least half of their support. 
Widow Or Widower 
If you are the widow or widower of a person who worked long enough under Social Security , you can : receive full benefits at full retirement age for survivors or reduced benefits as early as age 60. begin receiving benefits as early as age 50 if you are disabled and the disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. receive survivors benefits at any age , if you have not remarried and you take care of the deceased worker's child who is under age 16 or is disabled and receives benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , your remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. A widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse cannot apply online for survivors benefits. You should contact Social Security at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 to request an appointment. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number at 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. If you wish to apply for disability benefits as a survivor , you can speed up the disability application process if you complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of your appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. 
A few other situations: 
If you already receive benefits as a spouse , your benefit will automatically convert to survivors benefits after we receive the report of death. If you are also eligible for retirement benefits but haven't applied yet , you have an additional option. You can apply for retirement or survivors benefits now and switch to the other higher benefit at a later date. For those already receiving retirement benefits , you can only apply for benefits as a widow or widower if the retirement benefit you receive is less than the benefits you would receive as a survivor. 
Surviving Divorced Spouse 
If you are the divorced spouse of a worker who dies , you could get benefits the same as a widow or widower, provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to you as a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amount for other survivors getting benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , the remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. If you are caring for a child under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on the record of your former spouse , you would not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your former spouse's natural or legally adopted child. 
Minor Or Disabled Child 
If you are the unmarried child under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time of a worker who dies , you can be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. And you can get benefits at any age if you were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides the worker's natural children , their stepchildren, grandchildren, or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. 
For Your Parents 
If you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions. Besides being the natural parent , you could also be the stepparent, or the adoptive parent if you became the deceased worker s parent before he or she was age 16. 
Survivors Benefit Amount 
Your survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death benefit. 
Maximum Family Amount 
There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. 
Other Things You Need To Know 
There are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected. 
A Special Lump-Sum Death Payment 
A surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump - sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Generally , the lump - sum is paid to the surviving spouse who was living in the same household as the worker when they died. If they were living apart , the surviving spouse can still receive the lump - sum if, during the month the worker died, they : were already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If there's no eligible surviving spouse , the lump - sum can be paid to the worker's child or children if, during the month the worker died, the child : was already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If the eligible surviving spouse or child is not currently receiving benefits , they must apply for this payment within two years of the date of death. For more information about this lump - sum payment , contact your local Social Security office or call 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778.

document : Disability is a subject you may read about in the newspaper, but not think of as something that might actually happen to you. But your chances of becoming disabled are probably greater than you realize. Studies show that just over one in four of today's 20-year - olds will become disabled before reaching age 67. While we spend a lot of time working to succeed in our jobs and careers , few of us think about ensuring that we have a safety net to fall back on should we become disabled. This is an area where Social Security can provide valuable help to you. This disability planner helps you find out : how you can qualify and apply for benefits ; what happens if your application is approved ; who can receive benefits on your earnings record ; what you need to know about receiving disability benefits ; when Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries ; and what happens if you go back to work. 
Disability and Supplemental Security Income 
We pay disability benefits under two programs : The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22. The Supplemental Security Income SSI program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources. For most people , the medical requirements are the same under both programs and disability is determined by the same process. Whether you apply for Social Security disability or SSI , we ask you for information about your medical condition, work, and education history to help us decide if you are disabled under our rules. Additional information about SSI can be found at " What Is Supplemental Security Income? "

document : The law requires an adjustment to your monthly Medicare Part B medical insurance and Medicare prescription drug coverage premiums. This affects less than five percent of people with Medicare. Most people don t pay higher premiums. 
If You Have a Higher Income 
If you have higher income , you ll pay an additional premium amount for Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. We call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount. Here s how it works : Part B helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care. It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs. If you re a higher - income beneficiary with Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount, which is based on what you report to the IRS. Because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium. We tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium, not your own premium amount. If you re a higher - income beneficiary , we deduct this amount from your monthly Social Security payments regardless of how you usually pay your monthly prescription plan premiums. If the amount is greater than your monthly payment from Social Security, or you don t get monthly payments , you ll get a separate bill from another federal agency, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Railroad Retirement Board. 
How Social Security Determines You Have a Higher Premium 
Social Security uses the most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. If you must pay higher premiums , we use a sliding scale to calculate the adjustments, based on your modified adjusted gross income MAGI. Your MAGI is your total adjusted gross income and tax - exempt interest income. If you file your taxes as married, filing jointly and your MAGI is greater than $170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you file your taxes using a different status, and your MAGI is greater than $85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums. See the chart below, Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI, for an idea of what you can expect to pay. If you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination. If you have both Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each. If you have only one Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have. If you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year, and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll. In this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination. Remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you. 
Your Tax Return 
To determine your 2020 income - related monthly adjustment amounts , we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. Generally , this information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes , the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017. If we use the 2017 tax year data , and you filed a return for tax year 2018 or did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2018 , call us or visit any local Social Security office. We ll update our records. If you amended your tax return , we count and it changes the income to determine the income - related monthly adjustment amounts your MAGI , let us know. Social Security needs to see a copy of the amended tax return you filed and your acknowledgment receipt from IRS. We ll update our records with the information you provide, and correct or remove your income - related monthly adjustment amounts, as appropriate. 
If Your Income Has Gone Down 
If your income has gone down due to any of the following situations, and the change makes a difference in the income level we consider , contact us to explain that you have new information and may need a new decision about your income - related monthly adjustment amount : You married, divorced, or became widowed. You or your spouse stopped working or reduced your work hours. You or your spouse lost income - producing property because of a disaster or other event beyond your control. You or your spouse experienced a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer s pension plan. You or your spouse received a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer s closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization. If any of the above applies to you , we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar. If you filed a federal income tax return for the year in question , you need to show us your signed copy of the return. Use Form Medicare Income - Related Monthly Adjustment Amount Life - Changing Event to report a major life - changing event. If your income has gone down , you may also use Form SSA-44 to request a reduction in your income - related monthly adjustment amount. You can find Form SSA-44. 
Monthly Medicare premiums for 2020 
The standard Part B premium for 2020 is $144.60. If you re single and filed an individual tax return, or married and filed a joint tax return , the following chart applies to you : If you re married and lived with your spouse at some time during the taxable year, but filed a separate tax return , the following chart applies to you :

title : Benefits Planner: Retirement | Government Pension Offset (GPO) Calculator | Social Security Administration#2
document : 
What is Government Pension Offset (GPO)? 
If you will receive a pension for work not covered by Social Security such as government employment , any Social Security benefits you may be eligible to receive on your spouse's record may be reduced. This type of benefit reduction is called GPO. Some individuals are exempt from the offset. If you want to know if you meet the requirements for an exemption , please read the " When won't my Social Security benefits be reduced? " section of our " Government Pension Offset " factsheet. 
Information You Need to Calculate Your Benefits If You Are Affected by the GPO 
To estimate your future spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefits under the GPO , you need two things : The estimated " gross " monthly amount of your pension from your government job not covered by Social Security. The estimated monthly amount of your Social Security benefit as a spouse, widow, or widower before the effect of GPO. 
If you will be eligible for spouse's benefits and have access to your spouse's estimate: 
Find the estimated amount of the retirement benefit your spouse would be eligible to receive at full retirement age. If your spouse already receives benefits , ask them what their benefit would be if it started at their full or normal retirement age. Divide this amount in half and round down to the nearest dollar. This is your estimated spouse's benefit if you retire at full retirement age. 
If you will be eligible for a Social Security retirement benefit based on your own earnings: 
As well as a higher benefit based on your spouse's earnings , it will also affect your benefits as a spouse, widow, or widower. To get a more accurate estimate of how the government pension you will receive for work not covered by Social Security will affect the part of your benefit based on your spouse's work : Enter the estimated " gross " monthly amount of the government pension in today's dollars you will receive for work not covered by Social Security in Step #1 of " Calculate Your Benefits. " Use your most recent estimate to determine your estimated retirement benefit based on your own earnings. Subtract the estimated amount of your retirement benefit from the estimated amount of your spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit before GPO. Enter that amount in Step #2 of " Calculate Your Benefits " and select " Compute. " The amount in #3 of " Calculate Your Benefits " is your estimated spouse's, widow's, or widower's benefit after GPO is applied. Add that figure to the estimated amount of your retirement benefit to find your total estimated monthly benefit. 
If you retire before full retirement age: 
Your benefit amount as a spouse will be reduced. (The reduction will vary based on your date of birth. The maximum reduction for benefits starting at age 62 is 30 percent for someone born in 1946. It will increase to 35 percent for those born in 1960 or later.)

title : Affordable Care Act (ACA) And Your Coverage | Veterans Affairs#1
document : 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and your VA health care coverage 
The Affordable Care Act ACA also known as the health care law was created to expand access to coverage, control health care costs, and improve health care quality and care coordination. Find out what you need to know about the ACA and your health coverage. 
Do I still have to pay a penalty if I don t have health insurance? 
You don t have to pay a penalty if you don t have health insurance in 2019 or any year after that. Through the end of 2018 , the ACA required all U.S. taxpayers to have health coverage that met a minimum standard called the minimum essential coverage requirement unless they qualified for an exemption due to certain life events, financial status, or other factors. This meant that if you had affordable health coverage options, but chose not to buy health insurance, you would have to pay a fee when filing your taxes. This fee was known as an individual shared responsibility payment. It was also sometimes called the penalty, fine, or individual mandate. Congress changed this part of the law for plans starting in 2019 and after. The individual shared responsibility payment no longer applies starting in plan year 2019 for which you ll file taxes in April 2020. Note: If you didn t have coverage or an exemption in 2018 , you may still have to pay a fee when you file your 2018 taxes in April 2019. Go to HealthCare.gov to learn more about exemptions 
Does my health coverage through VA meet the ACA s minimum essential coverage requirement for 2018? 
Your health coverage meets the minimum essential coverage requirement for 2018 if you were signed up for one of the programs listed below. If you were covered under one of these programs in 2018 , you won t have to pay the fee when you file your 2018 taxes. To qualify , you must have been enrolled in one of these programs : The VA health care program , or The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs CHAMPVA , or CHAMPVA through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers , or The Spina Bifida Health Care Benefits Program , or that provides minimum essential coverage A Department of Defense TRICARE plan 
Does the ACA change my VA health benefits? 
No. The health care law doesn t change your VA health benefits or your out - of - pocket costs. 
If I m not signed up for a VA or Department of Defense health care program, how do I get health coverage for 2019? 
You may be able to get coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Open enrollment for 2019 is over. But you can still enroll or change plans if you have certain life changes or qualify for free or low - cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP. Go to HealthCare.gov to find out if you can enroll or change your plan

Your school : Offers the Yellow Ribbon Program , and Hasn t offered the Yellow Ribbon benefit to more than the maximum number of students in their agreement with us , and Has certified your enrollment with us and provided Yellow Ribbon Program information See the list of schools that offer the Yellow Ribbon Program this year 
What benefits can I get through this program? 
Money to help pay for the higher cost of tuition at a private school or for attendance as a nonresident student at a public school. If you qualify , your school will contribute a certain amount toward your extra tuition and fees through a grant, scholarship, or similar program. We ll match the contribution. 
How do I get this benefit? 

Apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits 
Apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits If you qualify for benefits , you ll get a Certificate of Eligibility COE. 
Turn in your COE to your school 
Bring your COE to your school s certifying official, or to the financial aid, military liaison, or other appropriate office. Ask to apply for your school s Yellow Ribbon Program. 
Wait for a decision 
Your school will decide : Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of students for the program period. Enrollment is on a first - come, first - served basis. We have an agreement with each school about how many students they ll cover each year. How much funding you ll receive. Your school decides this amount. They ll add up tuition and mandatory fees, then subtract any aid you ve received from other sources such as scholarships, grants, and your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school will apply the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount. 
Follow up 
You ll get a notice from your school about whether it has accepted you into the program and how much money you ll receive for tuition.

How much funding you ll receive through the program 
This depends on the school. Schools can choose to offer different amounts to students based on 2 factors : Student status undergraduate, graduate, doctoral , and Type of school college or professional For example : A school could provide $1,000 for undergraduates, $1,500 for graduate students, and $2,000 for doctoral students. The school also could provide $1,800 for students in the school of engineering and $2,500 for students in the school of nursing. This depends on the agreement we have with your school. Your school s agreement with us states how much it will contribute and how much we ll match. This amount makes up all or part of the difference between what the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay and the unmet tuition and fees. Here s how it works : Let s say you re attending a public school as an out - of - state student. The school charges $10,000 per year for in - state tuition and fees, but $16,000 per year for out - of - state tuition and fees. We ll pay the in - state $10,000 cost under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. But you ll need to pay the extra $6,000 for the out - of - state cost. If you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program , you can get some or all of that extra amount paid. We ll match the amount your school contributes to the program. So if your school funds $3,000 of your tuition , we ll also pay $3,000 to your school , and you ll be covered for the full amount. If your school funds $2,000 through the Yellow Ribbon Program , we ll also pay $2,000 to your school , and you ll need to pay the remaining $2,000. Note: Your school s agreement may also state that they ll contribute only toward degrees at certain colleges or professional schools, or only for certain degree levels like undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral degrees. Learn more about each school s agreement No. You don t have to attend full - time to be in the program. First , we ll determine how much the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay. We ll do this by subtracting any financial aid you have that s designated solely for paying tuition and fees from the total amount your school charges. Then , your school s funding through the Yellow Ribbon Program and our matching contributions can cover part or all of the remaining unmet charges. Yellow Ribbon funds may cover any mandatory required fees for your education program. Yellow Ribbon and Post-9/11 GI Bill funds won t cover any fees that aren t mandatory, such as : Room and board Study abroad unless your degree program requires the study abroad course Penalty fees like fees for late registration, returned checks, or parking fines Yes , if your school still has Yellow Ribbon funds available for the per - student maximum contribution for the summer term. 
How your benefits may change from year to year 
Not always. We require a new Yellow Ribbon Program agreement each year. If your school has an approved agreement with us and continues to participate in the program , they must continue to offer the Yellow Ribbon benefits to you the next year as long as you meet all of the requirements listed below. All of these must be true. You: Make acceptable progress toward completing your program according to your school , and Stay enrolled in the school without a break following the school s policy, and Have money left in your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits Check the status of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits If you transfer to a different school , your new school needs to offer Yellow Ribbon benefits and accept your application for you to continue in the program. Your first school s decision doesn t affect your new school s decision. No. Even if you stay enrolled , keep progressing in your program , and have money left in your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits , your school can choose to offer a different amount each year. Your school must notify you if they plan to stop offering the program. If you take fewer courses , we ll pay less toward your tuition and fees. Your school will also reduce the amount they pay. We base refunds on each school s refund policy. You ll need to pay us back for any overpayments we may have made to the school that they don t refund. If the school still offers the program , they must continue to give you funding as long as you meet all of the requirements listed below. All of these must be true. You: Make acceptable progress toward completing your program according to your school , and Stay enrolled in the school without a break following the school s policy, and Have money left in your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits Check the status of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits

title : VA Health Care And Other Insurance | Veterans Affairs#1
document : 
VA health care and other insurance 
If you have other forms of health care coverage like a private insurance plan, Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE , you can use VA health care benefits along with these plans. Learn more about how VA works with other health insurance. 
Why does VA require me to provide information on my health insurance coverage (including coverage under a spouse s plan)? 
We ask for this information because we have to bill your private health insurance provider for any care, supplies, or medicine we provide to treat your non - service - connected conditions illnesses or injuries that aren t related to your military service. We don t bill Medicare or Medicaid , but we may bill Medicare supplemental health insurance for covered services. 
What if my health insurance provider doesn t cover all the non-service-connected care that VA bills them for? 
You won t have to pay any unpaid balance not covered by your health insurance provider. But , depending on your assigned priority group , you may have a copay for non - service - connected care. Learn more about eligibility priority groups 
Does it help me in any way to give VA my health insurance information? 
Yes. Giving us your health insurance information helps you because : When your private health insurance provider pays us for your non - service - connected care , we may be able to use the funds to offset part or all of your VA copayment. Your private insurer may apply your VA health care charges toward your annual deductible the amount of money you pay toward your care each year before your insurance starts paying for care. 
Does my current health insurance status affect whether I can get VA health care benefits? 
No. Whether or not you have health insurance coverage doesn t affect the VA health care benefits you can get. 
If I m signed up for the VA health care program, does that mean I meet the requirements to have health care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? 
Yes. Being signed up for VA health care meets your Affordable Care Act health coverage requirement of having minimum essential health coverage. You don t need any other insurance to meet this requirement. We ll update this site if the ACA changes with new laws. Learn more about the ACA, VA, and you Note: It s always a good idea to let your VA doctor know if you re receiving care outside VA. This helps your provider coordinate your care to help keep you safe and make sure you re getting care that s proven to work and that meets your specific needs. 
More about how VA health care works with Medicare and other insurance 
This is your decision. You can save money if you drop your private health insurance , but there are risks. We encourage you to keep your insurance because : We don t normally provide care for Veterans family members. So , if you drop your private insurance plan , your family may not have health coverage. We don t know if Congress will provide enough funding in future years for us to care for all Veterans who are signed up for VA health care. If you re in one of the lower priority groups , you could lose your VA health care benefits in the future. If you don t keep your private insurance , this would leave you without health coverage. If you have Medicare Part B coverage for doctors and outpatient services and you cancel it , you won t be able to get it back until January of the following year. You may also have to pay a penalty to get your coverage back called reinstating your coverage. Yes. We encourage you to sign up for Medicare as soon as you can. This is because : We don t know if Congress will provide enough funding in future years for us to provide care for all Veterans who are signed up for VA health care. If you re in one of the lower priority groups , you could lose your VA health care benefits in the future. Having Medicare means you re covered if you need to go to a non - VA hospital or doctor so you have more options to choose from. If you delay signing up for Medicare Part B coverage for doctors and outpatient services and then need to sign up later because you lose your VA health care benefits or need more choice in care options , you ll pay a penalty. This penalty gets bigger each year you delay signing up and you ll pay it every year for the rest of your life. If you sign up for Medicare Part D coverage for prescription drugs , you ll be able to use it to get medicine from non - VA doctors and fill your prescriptions at your local pharmacy instead of through the VA mail - order service. There s no penalty for delaying Medicare Part D. You ll need to choose which benefits to use each time you receive care. To use VA benefits , you ll need to get care at a VA medical center or other VA location. We ll also cover your care if we pre - authorize you meaning we give you permission ahead of time to get services in a non - VA hospital or other care setting. Keep in mind that you may need to pay a VA copayment for non - service - connected care. If you go to a non - VA or VA authorized care facility , Medicare may pay for other services you may need during your stay. Or , if we only authorize some services in a non - VA location , then Medicare may pay for other services you may need during your stay. Check your Medicare plan , so you know which care locations and services you re covered for. Learn more about Medicare Yes. We may bill and accept reimbursement from High Deductible Health Plans HDHPs for medical care and services to treat your non - service - connected conditions. If you have an HDHP linked to an HSA , you can use your HSA to pay your VA copayments for non - service - connected care. We may also accept reimbursement from HRAs for care we provide to treat your non - service - connected conditions. No. As a result of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, we no longer need permission to bill health insurance providers for care related to a sensitive diagnosis (like alcohol or drug abuse, alcoholism, HIV or HIV testing, sickle cell anemia, or other diagnoses included in Public Law 38 U.S.C. 7332-protected information). Before submitting any claims for care related to a sensitive diagnosis , we notified Veterans of this change by sending a one - time notice to all Veterans who had signed a release of information refusing to allow us to bill for care related to a sensitive diagnosis in the past. The Federal Register also published this change. Read the notice on the Federal Register website We re now submitting claims to health insurance carriers for all non - service - connected care, even if we don t have a signature or written authorization permitting us to disclose protected information on these claims or in Veterans medical records. We re required by law to bill your health insurance including your spouse s insurance if you re covered under the policy. The money collected goes back to VA medical centers to support health care costs provided to all Veterans. You can submit a restriction request asking us not to disclose your health information for billing purposes , but we re not required to grant your request. To submit a restriction request , please contact your nearest VA health facility and ask to talk with the privacy officer. You can also ask to talk with the billing office for more information.

title : VA claim exam (C&P exam) | Veterans Affairs#1
document : 
VA claim exam (C&P exam) 
After you file your disability benefits claim , we may ask you to have a claim exam also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam. Get answers to commonly asked questions about the VA claim exam below. 
Be sure not to miss your scheduled exam. 
If you miss your exam , we may not be able to reschedule you right away , and your claim may be delayed while you wait for a new appointment. Or we may need to rate your claim as - is. This means we ll base our decision about your disability benefits only on the evidence we have in your file, which may not be enough. 
Why might I need a VA claim exam? 
This exam will help us rate your disability. Your rating will be based on how severe your disability is and will affect how much disability compensation you ll receive. Compensation may include things like monthly payments and enrollment in the VA health care program. 
Does everyone who files a claim need to have a VA claim exam? 
No. We ll ask you to have a claim exam only if we need more information to decide your claim. If you have enough medical evidence in your file to support your claim , we won t ask you to have a claim exam. Medical evidence may include doctor and hospital reports, test results, and other documents. 
How to schedule your VA claim exam 
The staff at your local VA medical center or a local doctor s office that we partner with will contact you. They ll either send you a letter by mail with the date and time of your exam, or call you to find a time that works for you. Make sure both the VA regional office and the VA medical center nearest you have your up - to - date address, phone number, and email address so you get your exam notice in time. Call the number provided right away to confirm the time and location of your exam. It s important not to miss your scheduled exam , so you ll want to double check that you have the right place and time. If you can t make it to your appointment , let us know right away. You can most likely reschedule , but this may delay your claim. To reschedule your appointment : Call 800 - 827 - 1000 , or Go to your nearest VA regional benefit office. Find a VA regional benefit office near you 
What to expect at your VA claim exam 
You don t need to bring anything to your exam. If you have any new non - VA medical records like records from a recent surgery or illness , please be sure to submit them before your appointment. The health care provider can t review new information during the exam. If you have children , you ll need to plan ahead for childcare during your exam. Because you and the doctor may discuss sensitive topics , children shouldn t be in the room with you. On the day of the exam , you ll want to wear comfortable clothes so you can move freely while the doctor exams you. A VA claim exam isn t like a normal medical exam or other VA health care visits. The doctor won t treat you for any illness or injury, give you referrals to other health care providers, or prescribe medicine. That s because the purpose of the exam is to gather information that will help us make a decision on your claim. Each exam is different, depending on the information we need. During your exam , the doctor may do any or all of these things : Review your claim file with you Ask you questions based on the medical records in your claim file. These may include questions from the Disability Benefits Questionnaire for each service - connected condition you re claiming. Take a look at the Disability Benefits Questionnaires DBQs Perform a basic physical exam Ask you to get other tests like X - rays or blood work if needed If you have any questions about what s happening during your exam , feel free to ask the doctor. But keep in mind that the doctor s job is to examine you, not to make any decisions about your claim. They won t be able to answer questions about the claims process. After your exam , the doctor will write up a report and send it to a VA claims processor to be added to your claim file. Your exam may be very short , or it may last an hour or more. It all depends on the conditions you ve claimed and whether we need more information to make a decision. For example , the required questions the doctor asks about a knee injury may take only a few minutes. But the questions for a more complex illness or injury could take much longer. A mental health evaluation usually lasts 2 to 4 hours. It s important to remember that your in - person visit is only one part of the claim review process. The doctor will also spend time outside the exam carefully reviewing your records. Either a VA doctor or a non - VA doctor who we ve contracted with will do the exam. You can also have your own doctor examine you and fill out the necessary forms. Get instructions for your doctor to fill out VA claim exam forms No. The doctor will give the exam results to our VA claims processors. Our claims processors will decide your claim based on these results, plus your other medical and military records. If you have questions about the claims process , call your nearest VA regional benefit office. Find contact information for your nearest VA regional benefit office If you miss your claim exam , contact us right away to let us know why you didn t make it. We can help you figure out what to do next. If you have what we consider to be a good reason for missing your exam called good cause , we ll work with you to reschedule your exam. Examples of good cause might be an illness or the death of someone in your immediate family. Find contact information for your nearest VA regional benefit office 
After your VA claim exam 
We ll review all the evidence in your file, assign your disability rating, and send you a decision notice a letter letting you know your disability rating. Each claim is different , but it usually takes us about 3 to 4 months to process a claim from start to finish. The processing time for your claim depends on how complex your claim is and how many conditions you ve claimed. See our most recent estimate for the average number of days to complete a claim Sign in to track your claim Yes. To get a copy of the final report from your exam , you can : Contact your nearest VA regional benefit office , or Call us at 800 - 827 - 1000 and request an appointment to view your file Our VA claims processors will review : you ve given us The medical records The report from the doctor who handled your claim exam, and the results of any ordered medical tests Statements from you and others about your claim Your military medical and personnel records We may ask you to have a claim exam if you appeal your disability benefits decision.

title : Post-9/11 GI Bill | Veterans Affairs#1
document : 
Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) 
The Post-9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33 helps you pay for school or job training. If you ve served on active duty after September 10 , 2001 , you may qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33. Find out if you can get this education benefit. 
Am I eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits? 
You can get these education benefits if you meet at least one of the requirements listed below. At least one of these must be true. You: Served at least 90 days on active duty either all at once or with breaks in service on or after September 11 , 2001, or Received a Purple Heart on or after September 11 , 2001, and were honorably discharged after any amount of service , or Served for at least 30 continuous days all at once, without a break in service on or after September 11 , 2001 , and were honorably discharged with a service - connected disability, or Are a dependent child using benefits transferred by a qualifying Veteran or service member Note: If you re a member of the Reserves who lost education benefits when the Reserve Educational Assistance Program REAP ended in November 2015 , you may qualify to receive restored benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. 
What if I qualify for other VA education benefits too? 
You ll have to pick which benefit you d like to use. This is an irrevocable decision, meaning you can t change your mind. 
What benefits can I get through the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)? 
You can receive up to 36 months of benefits, including : Tuition and fees. If you qualify for the maximum benefit , we ll cover the full cost of public, in - state tuition and fees. We cap the rates for private and foreign schools, and update those rates each year. View current rates Money for housing if you re in school more than half time. We ll base your monthly housing allowance on the cost of living where your school is located. Money for books and supplies. You can receive up to $1,000 per school year. Money to help you move from a rural area to go to school. You may qualify for this one - time payment of $500 if you live in a county with 6 or fewer people per square mile and you re either moving at least 500 miles to go to school or have no other option but to fly by plane to get to your school. Here s how we ll determine how much of the benefit you ll qualify for : The specific amount you ll receive will depend on how much active service you ve had since September 10 , 2001. We ll calculate this amount based on a percentage of the maximum benefit. For example : If you had 90 days of active service since September 10 , 2001 , you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. If you served for 3 years , you would qualify for 100% of the benefit. So if your school charges $22,000 for in - state tuition and fees , you would receive $8,800 if you had 90 days of active service and the full $22,000 if you had 3 years of active service. Note that this will change August 1 , 2020. In this example , 90 days of active service would qualify you for 50% of the maximum amount as of August 1 , 2020. 
Do these benefits expire? 
This depends on when you were discharged from active duty. If your service ended before January 1 , 2013 , your Post-9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33 benefits will expire 15 years after your last separation date from active service. You must use all of your benefits by that time or you ll lose whatever s left. If your service ended on or after January 1 , 2013 , your benefits won t expire thanks to a new law called the Forever GI Bill - Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act. Some letters you receive from us may not yet reflect this change. Thank you for your patience as we work to update our systems. Learn more about this new law 
How do I get these benefits? 
You ll need to apply. Apply for education benefits The benefit amount depends on which school you go to, how much active - duty service you ve had since September 10 , 2001, and how many credits or training hours you re taking. 
How do I know how much of my Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are left? 
If you already applied for and were awarded Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits , your GI Bill Statement of Benefits will show you how much of your benefits you ve used and how much you have left to use. View your GI Bill Statement of Benefits 
Can my family members or I get any additional benefits through the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)? 
You may qualify for these additional benefits : If you need more money to cover higher private - school or out - of - state tuition , you can apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program. Learn about the Yellow Ribbon Program If you re a qualified service member , you can transfer all 36 months or a portion of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or child. The Department of Defense approves a transfer of benefits.

How can I use my Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits?

What is the Location-Based Housing Allowance (Section 107)? 
What is Section 107 Location - Based Housing Allowance? Previously , GI Bill beneficiaries were paid Monthly Housing Allowance MHA based on the main or branch campus of the school they were enrolled. If a student attended classes at more than one location , they were paid the rate that was most advantageous. Now , MHA is based on the campus location where the student physically attends the majority of their classes.

What if I have more than one disability? 
We use a method called the whole person theory to determine what we call your combined disability rating. We do this to make sure that your total VA disability rating doesn t add up to more than 100 %. That s because a person can t be more than 100% able - bodied. Read below to find out more about how we calculate your combined disability rating. 
How do ratings work for a disability I had before entering the service that got worse because of my service? 
If you get disability benefits for a preservice disability , we base your monthly compensation amount on the level of aggravation. Level of aggravation means how much worse your preservice disability got because of your military service. For example : If you had an illness or injury also known as a condition that was rated as 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to the effects of your service , then the level of aggravation would be 10 %. 
Is there anything else, other than my disability rating, that may affect the amount of compensation I receive? 
Yes. We may increase or decrease your compensation amount in certain situations. Learn more about compensation rates

How we determine combined VA disability ratings 
If you have more than one disability , we use the combined ratings table below to calculate your combined disability rating. To make this table easier to use online , we ve separated it into smaller tables, based on the percentage of the most severe, or highest rated, disability. You can also download the full combined ratings table PDF. Note: If you have 2 disabilities, each rated at 10% disabling , your combined disability rating is 19 %.

How we use the combined ratings table 
We follow these steps to calculate your combined rating. 
Step 1 
We start by putting your disability ratings in order, from highest to lowest percentage. For example : If you had 2 disabilities rated as 50% disabling and 30% disabling , we d rank them in this order : 50%, then 30 %. 
Step 2 
Next , we look for your highest rating in the left column of the combined ratings table, and the next highest rating in the top row of the combined ratings table. In our example : We d look for 50 in the left column and 30 in the top row. 
Step 3 
Then , we look across from the 50 in the left column and down from the 30 in the top row to find the number that appears where the left column and top row meet. This is the combined value of the 2 ratings. In our example : This would be 65. 
Step 4 
If you have 2 disabilitiesWe round that combined value to the nearest 10% to find your combined disability rating. We round combined values ending in 1 to 4 down, and those ending in 5 to 9 up. In our example : Your combined disability rating would be 70 %. 
Step 5 
If you have more than 2 disabilities We repeat the process for each additional disability. This means we take the combined value before rounding of the first 2 disability ratings and then combine that with the third highest rating, and so on until we ve added all disability ratings. We then round the final value to the nearest 10% to get your combined disability rating. For example : If we added a third disability rated at 10% disabling to our original example , we would take your combined value of 65 and look for that number in the left column of the combined ratings table. We would then look for 10 in the top row and find the number where the left column and top row meet. In this example , that number would be 69. We would then round this number up to 70% , and this would be your combined disability rating.

Frequently asked questions about decision reviews 

On this page 
What s new and relevant evidence? What s Duty to Assist? What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? What if I want to change my review option after submitting a form? How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? 
What s new and relevant evidence? 
In order to file a Supplemental Claim , you have to add evidence that s both new and relevant. New evidence is information that VA didn t have before the last decision. Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case. VA can t accept a Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence. You can either submit the evidence yourself or identify evidence, like medical records, that you d like VA to get for you. 
What s Duty to Assist? 
VA s Duty to Assist requires VA to assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that s needed to support your case. VA s Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim and if you file a Supplemental Claim. If you request a Higher - Level Review or Board Appeal , Duty to Assist doesn t apply. However , the reviewer or judge will look at whether VA met its Duty to Assist during your initial claim or Supplemental Claim , and if not, they ll have VA correct that error. Your review may take longer if this is needed. 
What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? 
Submitting your request on time will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit if your case is granted. Please check the deadline for each review option and submit your request before that date. If the deadline has passed , you can either : Add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim. Because the deadline has passed , the effective date for benefits will generally be tied to the date VA receives the new request, not the date VA received your initial claim. Send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error CUE. CUE is a specific and rare kind of error. To prove CUE , you must show that the correct facts, known at the time, were not before VA or that VA incorrectly applied the law as it existed at the time. It must be undebatable that an error occurred and that this error changed the outcome of your case. Misinterpretation of the facts or a failure by VA to meet its Duty to Assist aren t sufficient reasons. Please seek guidance from a qualified representative, as you can only request CUE once per decision. If you disagree with a Board decision , your decision will have information on additional ways to address errors. 
What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? 
If you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer on the Higher - Level Review option , they ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher - Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers , they ll leave a voice mail. During the call , you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won t be transcripts of this call. 
What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? 
You have the option to request a hearing with a judge. A video conference hearing will take place at a VA location near you. At your hearing , you and the judge will have a conversation. The judge will listen to your testimony. The judge may ask you a few questions. Your representative , if you have one , may help you at the hearing. The hearing will be transcribed and added to your appeal file. You can add new and relevant evidence within 90 days after the hearing , but it isn t required. 
What if I want to choose a different review option after I ve already submitted a form? 
If you ve submitted a form and want to change your review option , you can send in a new decision review request form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision. You must include a letter that says you want to withdraw your existing review and switch to a different option. If you requested a Board Appeal and want to switch to a different appeal option , you can send in a new Board Appeal form with a different option selected. You can switch appeal options within 1 year from the date on your VA decision or 60 days from the date you submitted your original form. You can t select a different appeal option if you ve already submitted evidence or had a hearing. 
How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? 
If you disagree with a VA decision you received before February 19 , 2019 , you can opt in to the modernized review system after you ve received a VA Statement of the Case SOC or Supplemental Statement of the Case SSOC. To get either a SOC or an SSOC , you must file a Notice of Disagreement VA Form 21 - 0958 within 1 year of the date on your decision. Find out how to file a Notice of Disagreement After you receive either a SOC or an SSOC on the issue in your Notice of Disagreement , you have 60 days or the remainder of the 1-year period following the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt in to the modernized system by submitting one of the following forms and checking the SOC / SSOC opt - in box : Decision Review Request : Supplemental Claim VA Form 20 - 0995 Decision Review Request : Higher - Level Review VA Form 20 - 0996 Decision Review Request : Board Appeal VA Form 10182 Download the forms or learn more about decision review options

How we assess and verify your income to determine eligibility and copays 

How does VA determine whether I'll need to pay copays based on my income? 
If you're not already receiving VA disability compensation or pension payments, or don't have special eligibility factors like receiving the Medal of Honor , we'll ask for information about your income as part of our health care enrollment process. This is called an income assessment or financial assessment formerly known as a means test. We re required by law to collect this information. We use your income information to help determine : If you re eligible for VA health care based on your income , and Whether you ll need to pay copays for certain types of care or medications Learn more about applying for VA health care 
Do I have to provide this information? 
If you qualify for VA health care enhanced eligibility status , you won't need to provide your income information. View the requirements for enhanced eligibility status If you don't qualify for enhanced eligibility status, but you agree to pay copays for your care , you don't have to provide your financial information. But if you don't , we may decline your enrollment. We also won't be able to consider your eligibility for free medications or beneficiary travel pay. Read more about providing financial information if : If you served in combat after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11 , 1998 , you don't have to provide your income to qualify for 5 years of free VA health care for any illness that may be related to your military service. You can still provide your income to help us determine if you re eligible for a higher priority group, beneficiary travel pay, or free care for conditions not related to your service. Learn more about VA health care for returning service members If you were exposed to Agent Orange in or near Vietnam, ionizing radiation in certain service locations or jobs, or environmental contaminants in the Persian Gulf, you don't have to provide your income information to qualify for free care related to your exposure. You can still provide your income to help us determine if you re eligible for a higher priority group, beneficiary travel pay, or free care for conditions not related to your service. Learn more about hazardous exposures 
What information do I need to provide? 
You ll need to provide your gross household income for the previous year. So if you re applying for health care in 2019 , you ll need to provide your gross household income for 2018. Your gross household income means the total amount of money you and anyone living with you in your home earned within one calendar year, before taxes. This includes your income from work as well as any other sources, like money you may have taken from a retirement fund or income from the sale of a house. If you have a spouse, partner, or dependent child who also contributes income to your family , you ll need to include this income in your application. 
Does VA verify the information I provide? 
This depends on your situation. If the information you provide shows that your income falls below our limits and qualifies you for free VA health care, medications, or both , we re required by law to verify the information. We do this by confirming your information with the Internal Revenue Service IRS and the Social Security Administration SSA. View our current income limits Because of tax deadlines , we usually begin this process in July, the year after you report your income. So , for example , if you provide information for the year 2018 , we ll verify it in July of 2019. If the information we receive from the IRS and the SSA shows that you have income above our limits , we ll send a letter notifying you and your spouse or partner if their income is part of your household income. You ll have the chance to dispute formally express your disagreement with this information. You can also send documents showing you have additional deductible expenses that we should consider. If you don't respond to our letter : After 45 days , we ll send you a reminder letter. After 75 days , we ll assume the information from the IRS and the SSA is correct. We ll send you a letter to explain the changes in your eligibility or copay status. We ll also explain how you can appeal our decision. If you respond by disputing the information in our letter : When we receive your response , we ll assign an income verification case manager to work with you and your representative, if you choose to have one. Your case manager will guide you through the process and help you find any authorized deductions that may reduce your total gross household income below our limits. We try to resolve all cases within 75 days. If our review shows that your income is still above our limits , we ll send you a final letter explaining that you ll need to pay copays for future care as well as for any care you received during the year for which we reviewed your income. We ll also explain how to appeal our decision. 
Once I m enrolled, do I need to update my income information every year? 
This depends on your situation : If you completed a financial assessment to find out if you were eligible for cost - free medications or for beneficiary travel pay but not for free VA health care , you ll need to provide updated income information each year. If we determine you re eligible for free VA health care because your household income is below our income limit , you don t have to provide updated income information each year. We ll receive your income information from the IRS and the SSA each year to confirm that you re still eligible for free VA health care. We ll contact you only if this information changes your eligibility or copay requirements. If you disagree with the information , you can keep using VA health care services while we review your situation. Note: Even when not required , we encourage you to report changes in your income. It's also important to let us know about changes to your personal information like your address, phone number, dependents, or other health insurance. You can do this any time by using our Health Benefits Update Form VA Form 10 - 10EZR. Learn how to submit your VA Form 10 - 10EZR

title : About point reduction#3
document : Completing a Point and Insurance Reduction Program PIRP course does not remove a violation, conviction, or the number of points from your driving record. Even after you complete the course , most violations, convictions and points will continue to show on your driving record for up to 4 years. Violations and convictions involving drugs or alcohol will remain on your driving record for ten or fifteen years, depending on the violation. If you get 11 points for traffic violations in an 18-month period , your driver license may be suspended. " Point reduction " means the number of points on your driving record used to calculate the number of total points received within 18 months will be reduced by 4 points and may help you avoid a suspension. See About the NY State Point System [1] for more information about how points are calculated. 
How do I receive the point reduction? 
The PIRP course sponsor will notify the DMV within 10 weeks after you complete the course. DMV will then reduce the active points on your driving record by up to 4 points. 
How do I know my driving record shows my PIRP course completion? 
If you need to verify that your course completion is on your DMV record , you can request a copy of your driving record [2]. If your course completion is not recorded on your driving record more than 10 weeks after you completed it , contact the course sponsor. 
What effect does point reduction have on my license and driving record? 
Point reduction applies only to points assessed for violations that occurred within the eighteen months immediately before course completion. It does not affect points for earlier violations, and cannot be used as " credit " against future violations or points. Point reduction cannot reduce your point total lower than zero. If your license has already been revoked or suspended , the point reduction will not affect that action. If a violation hearing has already been scheduled , the point reduction will not affect that action. Point reduction does not prevent or cancel a mandatory revocation or suspension for violations such as DWI, DWAI, or three speeding violations within 18 months. You can only use a Point & Insurance Reduction Program course to reduce points once in a 18-month period. The DMV point system and your insurance company s " point " systems are separate and not related. Point reduction on your driving record does not affect points assigned by your insurance company for violations and accidents. Completion of a course under the Point & Insurance Reduction Program also cannot prevent or reduce the calculation of points affecting a Driver Responsibility Assessment. [3]

Know Your Rights If a Complaint or Other DMV Charges have been Filed Against You 

Protect Your Facility License, Registration or Certification 

What to do if a complaint is filed against you 
The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles regulates all Repair Shops, Inspection Stations, Dealers, Vehicle Dismantlers and other related businesses in NYS. To legally operate as such a business , you must register with DMV. Once your application is approved you will receive a certificate from DMV. A copy of the Commissioner's Regulations that pertain to your type of business may be found on the DMV web site at dmv.ny.gov [1]. They will explain your responsibilities to consumers. You must follow all consumer protection laws and regulations. DMV advises all consumers who have a complaint against a dealer, inspection station, repair shop, or dismantler to make an attempt to resolve their complaint with the business manager. If they are not successful , they are advised to contact the DMV Consumer & Facilities Services Complaint Unit. Protect Your Business : Keep a copy of all work orders in an easy - to - access location. 
The Complaint Process 
If a complaint has been filed against you , a Consumer Services Rep from DMV will contact you in an attempt to resolve this complaint. The CSR will explain the nature of the complaint and will also inform you of your rights, responsibilities, and your liability. If the complaint is not resolved with the CSR , the case will be sent to an Automotive Facilities Inspector AFI for a formal investigation. Avoid costly penalties, fines, and the loss of valuable customersby responding to all DMV inquiries in a timely manner. The AFI will conduct a formal investigation. The result may be no action, a warning letter Notice of Investigation placed in your file, or a formal administrative hearing before an Administrative Law Judge ALJ. When Vehicle Safety initiates the hearing process , you may be offered the opportunity through a " hearing waiver " to admit to the charges and to either pay a specified monetary penalty and/or to accept a suspension. If the waiver is accepted , no hearing is required. If the offer is rejected , a hearing must be held. The result of the hearing may be no action, a civil penalty, and/or a suspension or revocation of your ability to operate as a vehicle related business in NYS. You may also be offered the opportunity to pay restitution to the consumer in lieu of the fines and/or penalties, or to have the penalty reduced. 
The Hearing Process 
You are entitled to hire an attorney and to bring that attorney to the hearing. The Department of Motor Vehicles is the petitioner is this case and the complainant may be a witness for the case. As a result of the hearing , the ALJ may sustain some, all, or none of the charges. There may be no action, a warning, the imposition of a suspension, revocation, and/or civil penalties. If the ALJ only imposes civil penalties , in order to prevent the loss of your operating privilege , you must pay all fines and penalties. You will receive a letter from DMV shortly after the hearing. You will have 30 days from the date of the order by the judge to pay your fine or penalty. Failure to pay any fines or penalties or to serve out your suspension will result in indefinite suspension of your business certificate and the possible assessment of a lien against your business. However , if you pay your fine and/or penalty or serve out your period of suspension , you will be back in business after complete compliance. If you are revoked , you must surrender all supplies and cease to operate. You have the right to appeal any adverse decision. If you chose to appeal , you have 60 days from the date of the ALJs decision to file the Administrative Appeal Form [2] AA-33A, which must be accompanied by the appropriate filing fee.

title : Parking for People with Disabilities - The Law#3
document : For information on how to apply, see Parking for People with Disabilities [1 ] Reserved parking for people with disabilities ensures safe and equal access to goods and services, access which most of us take for granted. This publication explains the rules that businesses and all drivers should observe about reserved parking spaces. It also presents information on how to obtain license plates and parking permits that allow individuals with severe disabilities to use specially - marked parking spots. Reserved parking for people with disabilities is a legal requirement, not just a courtesy. You can help support the law by parking in reserved spaces only if you have a permit or plates for people with disabilities, and only when the person who received the permit or plates is actually in the vehicle. Please avoid parking in the access aisle or striped area next to a reserved parking space - it is not a parking zone. This special area is needed for access by people who use wheelchairs and specially - equipped vehicles. It is important to respect each other. Please , be parking considerate. 
Qualifying Disabilities For Plates or a Parking Permit for People With Severe Disabilities: 
A qualifying disability is one or more of the following impairments, disabilities or conditions that are both permanent in nature and affect mobility : Use of portable oxygen ; Legal blindness ; Limited use, or no use, of one or both legs ; Inability to walk 200 feet without stopping ; A neuro - muscular dysfunction that severely limits mobility ; A Class III or IV cardiac condition American Heart Association standards ; Severe limitation in the ability to walk due to an arthritic, neurological or orthopedic condition ; Restriction because of lung disease to such an extent that forced respiratory expiratory volume for one second, when measured by spirometry, is less than one liter , or the arterial oxygen tension is less than sixty mm / hg of room air at rest ; Any other physical or mental impairment not previously listed which constitutes an equal degree of disability , and imposes unusual hardship in the use of public transportation and prevents the person from getting around without great difficulty. A , valid for six months , may be issued when a person has a temporarily disabling condition that makes the person unable to walk without a cane, crutches, a walker or other assisting device. Important : Who Can Certify a Disability To qualify for the license plates or the parking permit , you must present proof of the disability from a medical doctor MD, doctor of osteopathy DO, doctor of podiatric medicine DPM, licensed in NYS only or optometrist OD, for blindness. Only these medical professionals are considered " doctors " as the term is used in this publication. A doctor licensed in New York or another state may certify for conditions #1 through #8 previously listed. Only doctors licensed in New York State may certify for condition #9. A podiatrist must be licensed in NYS, and may certify applicants only for severe disabilities of the foot. 
Proof of Disability 
You may provide one of these proofs of disability : Have your doctor fill out the Medical Certification, Part II, on the " Application for License Plates and Parking Permits for People with Severe Disabilities " MV-664.1. This form may be used to apply for license plates for people with disabilities and is accepted by most localities for a parking permit. The form is available at any motor vehicle office, by request from the DMV Call Center, for the DMV Internet Office, and from most permit issuing agents in cities, towns and villages. To determine which governmental office issues permits in your area , contact your local town, city or village clerk. a hospital, clinic or medical facility ; the NYS Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in the NYS Department of Education ; or the NYS Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped in the Office of Children and Family Services for verification of legal blindness. If you have an obvious, visible, permanent disability, such as the complete or partial loss of a leg or foot, the requirement for a medical statement may be waived by a DMV supervisor if you are applying for the license plates, or by the local issuing agent if you are applying for a permit. If you have moved to NYS and want to apply for New York State license plates or a parking permit for people with disabilities , you must provide proof of disability listed in 1 - 3 of the sections above even if you had parking privileges in your former state. Your out - of - state permit cannot be accepted in exchange for a NYS permit or plates. If you already have license plates for people with disabilities , a locality may accept your registration as proof for issuing a permit. Check with your local issuing agent before applying. Under the New York State Vehicle & Traffic Law Section 392 , it is a criminal violation misdemeanor to make a false statement or give false information on an application for license plates. It is also a misdemeanor under the NYS Penal Law Section 210.45 to make a false statement or provide misinformation to obtain a parking permit for a person with a disability, and is punishable by fines from $250 to $1,000. Additional civil penalties from $250 to $1,000 may also be imposed under Section 1203-a 4 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. These penalties also apply to doctors providing certifications, as well as applicants. 
About Plates 
The Department of Motor Vehicles issues license plates for people with permanent disabilities for use on passenger cars, motorcycles, vans, and pickup trucks not used for commercial purposes. You do not have to be a resident of New York State or even a licensed driver to obtain the license plates , but you must be at least 16 years old to register a vehicle. License plates with the Universal Symbol of Access are only issued for a vehicle registered in the name of the person who has the disability , and each individual with a disability may have only one set of license plates. If you cannot register the vehicle in the name of the disabled person , refer to the section on Parking Permits. You may apply at any state or county motor vehicle office for a second set of license plates for another family member who also has a disability. In addition to providing the documentation for registering the vehicle , you also must provide the family member's driver license, proof of disability and a completed Application for License Plates and Parking Permits for People With Severe Disabilities [2] MV-664.1. Personalized license plates up to six characters with the Universal Symbol of Access are available for an additional charge. Please contact : NYS DMV Custom Plates UnitP.O. Box 2775Albany , NY 12220 If your vehicle already has a valid registration with New York license plates and you already have a permanent parking permit for people with disabilities that was issued in New York State , you must present this permit and a copy of the MV-664.1 showing the medical certification or doctor's statement used to obtain the parking permit. The medical certification must be dated no more than one year prior to the application for the license plates. Do NOT apply if you hold only a temporary parking permit. To apply , you must complete a Vehicle Registration / Title Application [3] MV-82 and pay a fee for the new plates displaying the Universal Symbol of Access. If this transaction is done at any time other than at renewal , a $3.75 transaction fee will be charged. If your vehicle already has a valid registration with New York license plates and you do NOT already have a permanent parking permit for people with disabilities , bring proof of your disability, your current New York plates and registration receipt to any state or county motor vehicle office. You will be required to fill out a Vehicle Registration / Title Application [3] MV-82 and pay a fee for the new plates showing the Universal Symbol of Access. If this transaction is done at any time other than at renewal , a $3.75 transaction fee will be charged. Do NOT apply if you hold only a temporary parking permit. If you are registering your vehicle for the first time, and you do not already have a permanent parking permit for people with disabilities , you must provide all of the items required for an original vehicle registration plus the proof of disability. 
Renewing Plates 
There is no additional fee for renewing a vehicle registered with plates for people with disabilities. You do not have to provide proof of disability when you renew your vehicle registration. However , when you sign your registration renewal notice you are certifying, under penalty of the law, that you have a severe disability and are eligible to have the license plates. Making a false certification is a misdemeanor. 
About Parking Permits 
You must live in New York State to be eligible for a permanent parking permit , but you need not be a licensed driver or own a vehicle. You must apply in the locality in which you live. A temporary parking permit, valid for six months, is available for a non - resident with a qualifying disability. State law requires every city, town and village to appoint an agent usually the city, town or village clerk to issue parking permits for people with disabilities. Contact your city, town or village clerk to find out which local agency issues the permits. There is no fee for the permit. DMV does not issue the parking permits. Localities follow the same general guidelines for issuing the permit as the DMV does for plates , but there may be some differences from one locality to another. Most issuing agents accept an MV-664.1. This form is available at any motor vehicle office, by request from a DMV Call Center, and from the DMV Internet Office. However , some localities have their own application form , and not all localities issue temporary permits. Contact your local issuing agent for specific information on how to obtain a permit in your area. A permit is issued to any person with a qualifying disability. This enables the permit may be used in any vehicle in which that person is riding. A local issuing agent also may issue parking permits to a state facility or an agency licensed by the state or locality. The permits will be issued only for vehicles primarily used to transport people with qualifying disabilities. To apply , the agency must provide a written request on its own letterhead describing its facility or agency, a copy of their New York State facility license and a list of the vehicles they use to transport people with disabilities. Each " permanent " or temporary permit has an expiration date. An expired permit is not valid and cannot be used. If your permit is due to expire , contact your local issuing agent to find out about the renewal procedures in your area. If your disability is not permanent , you may qualify for a temporary permit valid for up to six months. To apply for a temporary permit , you must present the same proof of disability as required for a permanent permit. The temporary permit will allow the same access to reserved parking spaces. If you have a temporary parking permit that is due to expire, and you still have a qualifying disability , you must obtain a new medical certification before you can apply for another parking permit. The permit is designed to hang from the rearview mirror when parked, but should be removed when the vehicle is being operated. If you lose your permit or it is stolen , immediately report it to the locality that issued the permit. 
Proper Use of Valid Permits or License Plates 
Any vehicle that has a license plate or valid permit displaying the Universal Symbol of Access may use parking spaces designated for use by a person with a disability. The person to whom the license plate or permit was issued must be traveling in the vehicle in order to use these spaces. Plates and permits do not allow you to disobey state or local parking regulations. They also do not exempt you from parking fees unless a locality has adopted an ordinance to that effect. The fine for illegally parking in a space reserved for people with disabilities is $50 to $150, plus a mandatory $30 surcharge. 
Misuse of Parking Permits or Plates 
It is a serious misuse of license plates and permits for people with disabilities when someone other that the person with a disability uses the plates or permit to park in a space reserved for people with disabilities. These license plates or parking permits are valid only when the person with a disability who received the plates or permit is driving the vehicle or is a passenger in it. If you misuse plates or a parking permit or allow someone else to use them , the DMV may revoke the license plates or the locality that issued the permit may revoke the permit , or they may deny renewal. 
Parking Spaces, Statewide 
Off - street parking spaces for people with disabilities are required by law at shopping centers that have five or more retail stores , and signs must be posted. Spaces reserved for people with disabilities must be located as close to the shopping center as possible and distributed to provide convenient access. A facility owner who does not comply may be fined up to $250. On - street parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities are designated by local law or ordinance. If you have a question about parking for people with disabilities on a particular street , contact the authorities responsible for maintaining the street. State and local laws and building codes also require reserved parking for people with disabilities at other facilities and when new parking lots are constructed. If you have a question about reserved parking at any facility with off - street parking , contact the facility management or the local building inspector. State, county or local law enforcement officers are authorized to enter the parking lot of any shopping center or other facility described in the State Building Code to enforce laws governing the use of parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities. 
Parking Spaces, New York City 
New York City does not set aside reserved spaces on its streets for persons with disabilities. Reserved parking spaces are only available off - street, in parking lots for shopping centers / malls, office / apartment buildings and college campuses. You can use the vehicle plates for people with disabilities or a state permit for people with disabilities to park in reserved spaces in those off - street lots. However , the NYC Department of Transportation issues a City permit a rectangular dashboard permit that allows persons with severe disabilities to park at most curbsides on NYC streets. City permits are issued to people with a permanent disability that so severely affects their ability to walk that they require the use of a private automobile. The New York City parking permit is not valid outside of NYC. For more information or to obtain an application for a NYC permit , call 718 433 - 3100 or visit the NYC Department of Transportation's web site [4]. 
Visiting from Out of State Or Traveling Outside New York State 
New York State honors out - of - state plates and permits for people with disabilities , and most other states also honor New York's permits and plates. To be sure if you travel to another state, check with the police or motor vehicle agency of the other state about whether they honor New York State issued license plates or permits for people with disabilities. Remember: Apply for plates or a permit for people with disabilities only if you have a qualifying disability. When parked , hang the parking permit from the vehicle's inside rearview mirror. Remove the permit from the mirror before driving. Use the parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities only if you have the license plates or parking permit , and only when the person with a disability is driving or riding in the vehicle. Never park in the access aisle or striped area next to a reserved parking space. This allows access to the parking space by people with wheelchairs and specially - equipped vehicles. It is not a parking zone. Do NOT allow others to misuse your plates or permit. When you use the license plates or parking permit for people with disabilities , you are NOT exempt from parking regulations or fees.

title : About the NYS Driver Point System#3
document : 
What is the Driver Violation Point System and how does it work? 
The Driver Violation Point System gives the New York State DMV a way to identify and take action against high risk drivers. The DMV assigns points for certain traffic violations. If you get 11 points in an 18-month period , your driver license may be suspended. 1 However , the point system is not the only way to lose your license see Suspensions and Revocations [1]. 
How your point total is calculated 
you must be convicted of the traffic violation before points are added to your driving record your point total is calculated based on the date of the violation, not the date of the conviction the points for violations that all occurred within the last 18 months are added to calculate your point total 2 
Number of points assigned for common traffic violations 

Points are not assigned for the following violations 
any bicycle violation any pedestrian violation any parking violation any violation related to unregistered, unlicensed or uninsured operation any violation related to motor vehicle inspection, vehicle weights or dimensions or vehicle equipment other than inadequate service brakes any violation related to a business or the sale of goods established in the Vehicle and Traffic Law or any local law a violation related to the improper use of High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes in Suffolk County, between exits 49 and 57 of the Long Island Expressway any other violation not resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle 
Driver Responsibility Assessment 
If you receive 6 or more points on your New York State driving record in 18 months , you must pay a Driver Responsibility Assessment fee [2]. 
Out-of-state convictions 
If you are convicted of a traffic violation in another state or country , points are not added to your New York State driving record, unless the violation occurred in Ontario or Quebec. New York State has a reciprocal agreement with Quebec and Ontario. Traffic violation convictions that occur in these provinces are recorded on your New York State driver record , and the convictions have the same effect and carry the same points as convictions that occur in New York State. This can affect your driver violation point total and Driver Responsibility Assessment. 
Insurance Premiums 
Insurance companies have their own point systems and can increase your premiums based on your driving record. Contact your insurance company for more information. 
Point and Insurance Reduction Program 
Taking a DMV - approved Point and Insurance Reduction Program PIRP course will help to prevent you from losing your license in the event you accrued 11 or more points on your driving record 4 points are' subtracted' for the purposes of a suspension if you have 11 or more points the tickets / pointsphysically come off your driving record save 10 percent on your automobile liability and collision insurance premiums Learn more about the PIRP course [3]. 
Check My Points 
You use the MyDMV' My License, Permit or ID' service to check your points. You will need the ID number and document number from your New York State driver license , learner permit , or Non - Driver ID Check my points through MyDMV [4] [4 ] If you claim that someone else committed a violation on your record , you can request a hearing. But you cannot request a DMV hearing to prove that you were not guilty of the violations. Once 18 months have passed from the violation date , the points for that violation no longer count toward your total. However , the points remain on your driving record as long as the conviction remains on your record and may be used by your insurance company to increase premiums.

title : Top 5 DMV Mistakes and How to Avoid Them#3
document : Many DMV customers make easily avoidable mistakes that cause them significant problems, including encounters with law enforcement and impounded vehicles. Because we see customers make these mistakes over and over again , we are issuing this list of the top five DMV mistakes and how to avoid them. 
1. Forgetting to Update Address 
By statute , you must report a change of address to DMV within ten days of moving. That is the case for the address associated with your license, as well as all the addresses associated with each registered vehicle, which may differ. It is not sufficient to only: write your new address on the back of your old license; tell the United States Postal Service; or inform the police officer writing you a ticket. If you fail to keep your address current , you will miss a suspension order and may be charged with operating an unregistered vehicle and/or aggravated unlicensed operation, both misdemeanors. This really happens , but the good news is this is a problem that is easily avoidable. Learn more about how to change the address on your license and registrations [1 ] 
2. Leaving the State Without Notifying DMV 
States communicate with each other , so when you move to another state, be sure to tie up any loose ends regarding your New York State license or registration. That means resolving any unanswered tickets, suspensions or revocations, and surrendering your license plates to NYS when you get to your new home state. A license suspension or revocation here could mean that your new home state will not issue you a license there. Remember , it is important to notify DMV of your new address so that any possible mail correspondence can reach you. Also , turning in your plates is important to avoid an insurance lapse. 
3. Letting Insurance Lapse 
Because we all pay indirectly for crashes involving uninsured motorists , New York State requires every motorist to maintain auto insurance every single day a vehicle is registered. DMV works with insurance companies to electronically monitor your insurance coverage , and we know when coverage is dropped for any reason. When that happens , we mail you an insurance inquiry letter to allow you to clear up the problem. We send 500,000 inquiry letters a year. If the inquiry letter does not resolve the problem , we must suspend the vehicle registration and , if it persists, your driver license!We suspend 300,000 registrations a year for failure to maintain insurance. If you fail to maintain an updated address with us , you won t learn that you have an insurance problem , and we will suspend your registration and license. Make sure you turn in your vehicle s license plates at DMV before you cancel your insurance policy. Insurance policies must be from a company licensed in New York State. Learn more about Insurances Lapes [2] and How to Surrender your Plates [3 ] 
4. Understanding how Much Traffic Points Cost 
DMV maintains a point system to track dangerous drivers. Often , motorists convicted of a traffic ticket feel they have resolved all their motoring issues with the local court, but later learn that the Driver Responsibility Assessment DRA is a separate DMV charge based on the total points they accumulate. The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years. Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record.

5. Not Bringing Proper Documentation to DMV Office 
About ten percent of customers visiting a DMV office do not bring what they need to complete their transaction, and have to come back a second time to finish their business. This can be as simple as not bringing sufficient funds to pay for a license renewal or not having the proof of auto insurance required to register a car. Better yet , don t visit a DMV office at all, and see if your transaction can be performed online, like an address change, registration renewal, license renewal, replacing a lost title, paying a DRA or scheduling a road test. Our award - winning website is recognized as one of the best in the nation. It has all the answers you need to efficiently perform any DMV transaction.

title : Leandra's Law & ignition interlock devices#3
document : 
What is "Leandra's Law"? 
Leandra's Law was signed into law on November 18 , 2009 in honor of Leandra Rosado. Leandra was an 11-year old killed while she rode in a vehicle with the intoxicated mother of one of her friends. In response to this tragedy , the NY State Legislature made several changes to the Vehicle and Traffic Law VTL. The law strengthened the penalties against motorists who drink and drive, and requires that any person sentenced for Driving While Intoxicated on or after August 15 , 2010 must have an ignition interlock device installed on any vehicle they own or operate the driver will have an " ignition interlock " restriction added to their driver license See additional information about Leandra's Law at the NY State Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Alcohol, Drugs and Impaired Driving [1] page. 
What are the different parts of Leandra's Law and what are the penalties for conviction? 
Leandra's Law includes the following provisions : The law established a new Class E Felony. The law states that no person shall operate a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs while a child who is 15 years of age or younger is a passenger in the vehicle. A court must sentence a person convicted of either to a period of probation or to a conditional discharge. The court must require the installation and use of an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or operated by a person convicted under this law.

If ignition interlock is ordered by a court , the system must be installed on each vehicle the motorist owns or operates. The device must remain installed for at least six months. The ignition interlock restriction will be added to the driver license record even if the license is revoked. The restriction will appear on the back of the driver license document as " interlock device ". Courts and probation departments will direct convicted motorists to vendors for ignition interlock installation. The NY State Division of Criminal Justice Services [2] website provides details on ignition interlock device vendors and information from the manufacturers of the device. 
How do I remove the ignition interlock restriction from my driver license? 
Your ignition interlock monitor must give you a form that states that you are no longer required to install and maintain the ignition interlock device in motor vehicles you own or operate. You must take this form to a local DMV office and apply for a new document without the restriction.

Motorcycles : You do not need to surrender motorcycle plates if there is a lapse in the liability insurance coverage. A motorcycle must have liability insurance to be operated. Trailers : Normally a trailer does not need liability insurance. The DMV will not suspend your driver license or registration if you fail to surrender the plate. The DMV recommends that you surrender any type of vehicle plate when the plate is not used to make sure that the plate is destroyed.

document : 
Stolen vehicles 
If your vehicle is stolen , report it to the police and your auto insurance company as soon as possible. The police will enter the information into national and state auto theft computer records. The theft will be noted on your vehicle title record to help prevent someone from selling the vehicle or applying for a title. 
How can I report stolen plates? 
Ask the police to complete a' Report of Lost or Stolen Motor Vehicle Items' form MV-78B for your stolen plates. The form is different from the stolen vehicle report , and it's available only from police agencies, not from DMV. Make a copy of the MV-78B report for your records, and bring the original form to a DMV office to surrender your registration. For further information , see Report or Replace Lost or Stolen Plates [1]. 
Do I need a duplicate (replacement) title? 
If your vehicle is not recovered , you may have to transfer ownership to your insurance company using your title certificate. If you have lost your title certificate , you must apply for a duplicate title. See Replace a Title Certificate [2] for more information. A duplicate title issued when a vehicle is stolen is marked to show the vehicle is stolen and that the duplicate title is valid for insurance transfer only. If your vehicle is recovered before you transfer the " insurance transfer only " title to your insurance company , make sure the police have cancelled the stolen vehicle alarm. Then send the title to the Title Bureau along with a letter explaining that your vehicle was recovered, and DMV will issue a regular title. The address for the Title Bureau is Title BureauNYS DMVPO Box 2750Albany , NY 12220 - 0750 
What if my title was not yet issued? 
If the vehicle was stolen before you were able to apply for registration and title in your name , you must first apply for a title in your name in order to transfer ownership to your insurance company. Obtain a letter from the insurance company on their letterhead stating that proof of ownership is required for insurance transfer only. Submit the letter with your Application for Title [Only] [3] MV-82TON. DMV will issue a New York State Salvage Certificate MV-907A in your name. The MV-907A is an ownership document that can be transferred to your insurance company. See Apply for a Title Certificate Only [4] at our website. 
Recovered vehicles 
If your vehicle is recovered , make sure the police cancel the stolen vehicle alarm so the recovery will be listed on your title record. Do not use the vehicle or apply for plates / registration until you are sure the alarm has been cancelled. If the vehicle is damaged or totaled , contact your auto insurance company. Do not apply for plates / registration as explained below until contacting your insurance company and resolving the matter with them. If the plates are recovered with your vehicle and you filed form MV-78B , bring the plates and your copy of the MV-78B to a DMV office to surrender them and apply for new plates and to re - instate your registration. If the plates are missing , bring your copy of form MV-78B to a DMV office and apply for new plates and reinstatement of your registration. If the vehicle and plates are recovered before you file form MV-78B, and the stolen vehicle alarm has been cancelled , your registration is still active and you may continue using the registration.

Copies of work orders and invoices are proof of your attempts to resolve the problem. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached and you wish to file a complaint , you must submit a Vehicle Safety Complaint Report PDF [2] VS-35 along with any supporting documents to the DMV Consumer & Facilities Services Complaint Unit. To submit electronically , download the complaint report available at the link above to your personal device.

Other related automotive businesses include vehicle dismantlers, salvage pools, mobile car crushers and itinerant vehicle collectors. We cannot take action against a facility unless we can find adequate evidence to substantiate the claim.

document : 
What To Do If You Receive A Traffic Ticket 

INTRODUCTION 
If you are issued a ticket for a non - criminal moving traffic violation in the five boroughs of New York City , it will be handled by a New York State Department of Motor Vehicles DMV Traffic Violations Bureau TVB. This allows courts in these areas to concentrate on criminal cases, including driving offenses, such as driving while intoxicated and driving while suspended or revoked aggravated unlicensed operation. However , TVBs do not handle parking violations. If you plead not guilty to a traffic ticket in one of these TVB areas , your case will be heard by a DMV Administrative Law Judge ALJ, an experienced attorney with special training in the Vehicle and Traffic Law. An ALJ has the authority to decide whether or not you are guilty and to set a fine if you are found guilty. An ALJ also has the authority to revoke or suspend your driver license and/or auto registration when required by law or when the ALJ believes it is in the interest of traffic safety. Just as in traffic courts in other areas of the state , you may present witnesses and evidence at a hearing before an ALJ and be represented by an attorney. 
IF YOU ARE ISSUED A TICKET 
Follow the instructions on the ticket for the plea you wish to make, and act promptly. If you don't answer the ticket in the time allowed , your driver license will be suspended. Later , you could be found guilty of the charge because of your failure to respond a default conviction. Your license would be suspended for not paying the fine and a judgment would be entered against you. Driving with a suspended license is a crime. A felony conviction may result in fines of up to $5,000, jail, probation, or confiscation of your vehicle. As the number of suspensions you have increases , the penalties also increase. A driver is suspended for ticket not answered and fine not paid. To Plead Not Guilty - Use the Traffic Ticket Pleas, Hearings and Payments online transaction [1] or read the " not guilty " instructions and check the " not guilty " box on the back of the ticket. Fill in the requested information , sign it , and mail the ticket to the Albany address listed. DMV will send you a letter telling you when and where to go for your hearing. If you are hearing impaired and require an interpreter , include a request for one when you mail your not guilty plea. An interpreter will be assigned to your hearing at no charge to you. 
ATTEND YOUR HEARING 
Hearings are open to the public. You may go to any TVB office to watch hearings so you know what to expect at yours. To Plead Guilty - Use the Traffic Ticket Pleas, Hearings and Payments online transaction [1] or read the instructions and check the " guilty " box on the back of the ticket. Fill in the requested information , sign it and , , either mail it with your payment to the Albany address listed on the ticket or bring your payment to any TVB office. You may pay the fine and surcharge by Visa or Mastercard, or by a check or money order payable to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Include the total fines and surcharges listed on the ticket for your violation. You may not plead guilty by mail if the charge against you will result in license or registration suspension or revocation upon conviction such as driving without insurance or a third speeding violation within 18 months. If you plead guilty to such a charge by mail , you will be notified that you must go to the TVB to answer the charge in person. Your Address - If your mailing address is different from the address written on the front of the ticket , please write the correct mailing address in the space provided on the back of the ticket. You may request your traffic ticket hearing to be postponed and rescheduled to a different date. For the ticket's first postponement , the appropriate TVB must receive your request by mail at least 10 days before the date of the scheduled hearing.

APPEALS

These are usually handled by a local parking violations bureau or court. The most common reasons your license may be suspended or revoked due to motor vehicle violations follow. Remember , your license also will be suspended if you do not answer a ticket or pay a fine. An ALJ has the authority to suspend or revoke your license for violations other than those listed. Speeding / Misdemeanors If you commit three speeding and/or misdemeanor traffic violations within 18 months , your license will be revoked for at least six months. New Driver Probation You are on license probation for six months after you pass a road test.

The points will be added to your record using the date the violation occurred, not the date you are found guilty. If your violation points in any 18-month period add up to 11 or more , your license may be revoked or suspended following a hearing. The ALJ usually holds the point hearing immediately after you are found guilty of a violation that brings your total to 11 or more points in 18 months. On the following panel is a list of common violations and the number of points for each. Taking a DMV - approved accident prevention course can reduce your point total by up to four points and reduce your auto liability and collision insurance premiums by 10% for three years.

For revoked NY State driver license holders who were approved for relicensing following a revocation , you cannot drive until your new NY State driver license is issued by a DMV issuing office. You will receive an approval packet from the Driver Improvement Unit. This packet contains instructions specific to you. Follow the instructions to apply for your new driver license. Depending on your NY State driver license record you may be approved with a Problem Driver Restriction and an Ignition Interlock Device IID.

Should you incur any violations / convictions , the approval may be withdrawn and favorable consideration may not be given to any future request for restoration of your New York State Driver license. If you are licensed by another state and you receive approval for restoration of your NY State driving privilege , you may resume driving in NY State if you have a valid out - of - state driver license. Note: Regardless if you are applying for a NY State driver license or driving privilege , any additional convictions of moving violations or other incidents added to your driving record can make you ineligible for approval or may delay the approval process. Driving privilege means that out - of - state drivers are allowed to drive a motor vehicle in New York State. A driving privilege can be suspended or revoked for the same reasons as are New York State driver licenses and carries the same penalties as driving with a suspended or revoked license. You will need to request approval by mail. Insurance Services BureauNYS DMV6 Empire State Plaza , Room 332BAlbany , NY 12228 1 - 518 - 474 - 0700

title : How insurance premium reduction works#3
document : The Point and Insurance Reduction Program PIRP is a DMV - approved course designed to teach motorists critical information about Highway Safety and Accident Prevention. 
How do I get the insurance premium reduction? 
The course sponsor will mail you a completion certificate within 45 business days after you complete the classroom course or 14 business days after you complete an online course. If you present your certificate to your insurance company or agent within 90 days after course completion , your liability and collision premium reduction will begin immediately, retroactive to the date you completed the course. If you present your certificate more than 90 days after course completion , the insurer may issue the premium discount effective from the date presented. If you do not receive your certificate within eight weeks after completion , immediately contact the program sponsor. You must take the course once every 36 months to maintain insurance reduction benefits. 
Will the PIRP course prevent my insurance company from raising my premiums? 
No. PIRP does not prevent general premium increases, or premium increases due to violations or accidents. It provides a 10% reduction for three years, from the base rate of your current liability, no - fault and collision premiums. 
What if more than one person named on a policy completes the PIRP course? 
Only the principal operator can receive the 10% reduction. 
Will youthful drivers and drivers participating in the assigned risk pool receive the insurance premium discount? 
Yes. Any insured driver who is the principal operator and completes a Point & Insurance Reduction Program course will receive the 10% reduction. 
If a youthful driver is already receiving a driver education reduction, will the PIRP discount also be applied? 
Contact your insurance company or agent to learn if both reductions will be given at the same time.

title : Lifetime driving records#3
document : 
What information appears on a lifetime driving record? 
A " lifetime " driving record contains all the license information DMV currently has available about a driver. The lifetime driving record will display all information still in DMV s possession regardless of the data retention requirements found in Vehicle and Traffic Law. The record may not include information that dates back to when a driver was initially granted driving privileges. A standard driver license abstract only contains information that DMV is still required to keep. For example , most suspensions and revocations are only shown on the standard driving record abstract for 4 years from the date the suspension or revocation ended. A lifetime driving record will show suspensions and revocations that are older than 4 years. Each driving record abstract contains information grouped within several sections.

title : Federal REAL ID#3
document : 
What REAL ID means to you 
Beginning on October 1 , 2020 , the federal government will require your driver license, permit or ID card to be REAL ID compliant if you wish to use it as identification to board a domestic flight within the U.S., or enter military bases and certain federal facilities. Enhanced driver license, permit, or non - driver ID [1] and valid U.S. Passport are already REAL ID compliant and can be used to board a flight. Please visit www.dhs.gov [2] for more REAL ID information. 
The REAL ID Act 
Passed by Congress in 2005 , the REAL ID Act establishes minimum security standards for state - issued driver licenses, permits and ID cards. The Act also prohibits federal agencies, like the Transportation Security Administration TSA, from accepting cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards. 
New York State DMV began issuing REAL ID licenses, permits, and ID cards on October 30, 2017 
You can get a REAL ID at any time , but you will need to go to a DMV Office. You cannot get a REAL ID online, by phone, or through mail.

If you a valid NY license, permit or ID card , you must bring your original social security card or W-2 with full SSN. If you a New York State driver license or identification card , you must bring your Social Security Card or a letter from the Social Security Administration proving your ineligibility to have a social security number. If you lost your Social Security Card , you must get a duplicate before you come to the DMV. The Social Security Administration website has more information on obtaining a duplicate card [4]. Proof of your date of birth. Proof of U.S. citizenship , lawful permanent residency or temporary lawful status in the U.S. Two different proofs of New York State residence such as utility bill, bank statement or mortgage statement (P.O.

title : About online and alternative delivery method courses (I-PIRP/ADM)#3
document : 
What is the I-PIRP/ADM Program? 
I - PIRP / ADM is an acronym for the Internet Point & Insurance Reduction Program / Alternate Delivery Method. This program permits approved sponsors to provide Defensive Driving / Accident Prevention courses via the Internet or other alternate delivery methods, such as DVD or digital cable. 
Who offers the I-PIRP courses? 
You must be sure any course you take for point and insurance reduction in New York State is a course approved by the NY State DMV. See the list of DMV approved sponsors for I - PIRP courses [1]. 
Do I receive point and insurance reduction if I take an I-PIRP course? 
Yes. When you complete an I - PIRP course , you receive the same benefits as when you complete a classroom PIRP course. You can reduce your driver violation point total by a maximum of four points , and you can save ten percent on your auto liability and collision insurance premiums. 
How long does it take to complete an I-PIRP course? 
The I - PIRP course requires a minimum of 320 minutes of instruction time. The instruction time does not include the time required to register, validate your identity and your participation, or to download and take any tests. The course site has controls to ensure you meet all the requirements and you have at least 320 minutes of instruction. 
How does the I-PIRP course compare to the classroom course? 
Both the classroom PIRP course and the I - PIRP course have very similar content and information , and both courses include 320 minutes of instruction. The classroom course is given in one daytime session or two evening sessions. You can take the I - PIRP course from home, at a convenient time for you. You must complete the I - PIRP course within 30 days of the date you register for the course. You can take the I - PIRP course at your own speed within the 30-day period. 
Can I log off and continue an I-PIRP course at a later time or use different computers for separate course sessions? 
Yes. You can complete the course in as many sessions as necessary , but you must complete the course within 30 calendar days of registration. Your data will be stored online for each course session. Most sponsors assign you a user ID and a password when you register for the course. You can use your ID and password to log in on any computer that can access the Internet with an acceptable connection. 
Are there tests or a final exam for an I-PIRP course? 
An I - PIRP course can have online quizzes, random tests and/or a final exam to verify your participation and determine if you understand the course content. Some sponsors may require you to take a final exam in person. Test requirements will be explained before you register for the course, normally in the course Terms and Conditions section. In addition to knowledge tests about course content , there will be questions to help verify your identity and participation in the course. 
What if I fail the quizzes, tests or final exam? 
The test and exam process and the effect of results can vary from one sponsor to another. Carefully read the information about tests before you register for the course. The course normally requires you to answer 70% of course content questions correctly. You normally will have two tries to get the correct answer to a question. Tests are timed , and you will have limited time during a test to look for an answer that you do not know. It is recommended that you review the section content before you begin the tests. 
What if I fail the course? Can I receive a course fee refund? 
If you do not meet all the requirements to complete the course or meet the minimum test score requirements , you cannot receive credit for course completion and you cannot receive point and insurance reduction for the course. A sponsor can offer for you to take the same course again at no additional costs. The sponsor is not required to offer this. 
What is the cost of an I-PIRP course? 
The cost is set by the course sponsor and the fee varies from one course to another course. Your cost is stated clearly before you register for the course. It is to your advantage to compare courses and their fees. 
How do I pay for an I-PIRP course? 
The sponsor will normally require you to pay with a credit card , but this is determined by each sponsor. Check with the sponsor for complete information about payment. 
What is the procedure for course cancellation and/or refunds? 
If the sponsor cannot conduct the course or any part of the course , they must give you the option to receive a full refund of all course fees. The sponsor can also offer you the option to reschedule the course, if and when the course is available. 
What type of equipment and technology do I need to take an I-PIRP course? 
The answer depends on the alternate delivery method ADM of the course. For example , if the course is an Internet course , you must have a computer and an acceptable connection to the Internet. For a DVD ADM course , you must have a television and a DVD player. The sponsors must provide any additional technology required to deliver the course. The sponsor must inform you of these requirements when you register for the course. 
How and when do I receive my course completion certificate? 
The course sponsor mails the course completion certificate to you by regular mail. An email copy of the certificate is not valid and will not be accepted by your insurance company. The course sponsor must issue the course completion certificates within 14 business days of course completion. Some sponsors offer express mail delivery options at an additional fee. 
Does the DMV send my completion certificate directly to my automobile insurance company? 
No. You must contact the insurance company and supply your certificate to them for insurance reduction benefits. 
Are the I-PIRP websites secured? 
Yes. The DMV requires that the sponsors and their delivery agents provide secure websites that protect the personal information of those who take the courses. 
What personal information is required to take the course? 
The sponsors collect personal information to verify your identity and your participation. This can include identity information like the DMV ID Number Client ID Number from your NY State driver license and your name and date of birth. You should make sure to use your name exactly as it appears on your New York State Driver License don t use nick names. The sponsor will also collect credit card information for the course fee. Identification and participation information can also include biometrics like keystrokes, facial recognition or voice recognition. 
Is my personal information kept after I finish the course? 
Read the privacy and security information at the web site of the I - PIRP sponsors. The sponsors are required to store your personal information on a secure server for a time period specified by DMV. The DMV verifies the security of the servers that host the course. 
What is done to ensure that the person who registers for the course is the person who takes the course? 
Each course sponsor has different methods to validate that the person who registered for the course is the same person who takes the course. Any person who attempts to defraud the system or who accepts a course completion certificate and its associated benefits without having personally completed the entire course has committed a crime and may be subject to prosecution, fines and imprisonment. Important : If you don t have a New York State DMV ID Number Client ID Number from your NY State driver license , the ADM course completion can t be applied to your license record. You may have to file Request for Driver and/or Vehicle Record Information form PDF [2] MV-15 before you attempt to take an ADM course. 

title : Medical Certification FAQ's#3
document : 
Self-Certification 

1. Why do I have to self-certify? 
New federal regulations require all commercial drivers to certify to the Department of Motor Vehicles DMV the type of driving they perform or expect to perform. Drivers that self - certify to a non - excepted driving type NA or NI are also required to submit a copy of their USDOT Medical Examiner s Certificate. This is a nationwide safety initiative that affects commercial driver in all states. 
2. What are the self-certification driving types? 
Non - Excepted Interstate NI : Commercial driving operation is permitted across state lines , and you are required to meet the Federal medical requirements Non - Excepted Intrastate NA : Commercial driving operation is restricted to New York State only , and you are required to meet the Federal medical requirements Excepted Interstate EI : Commercial driving operation is permitted across state lines for excepted operation only and you are exempt from the Federal medical requirements Excepted Intrastate EA : Commercial driving operation is restricted to New York State, permitted for excepted operation only and you are exempt from the Federal medical requirements. 
3. What if my driving type changes? 
If your driving type changes , you must go into your local DMV office to change your self - certification driving type and have your license amended to add or delete the appropriate restrictions. A transaction fee will apply. If you are self - certifying to a non - excepted driving type NA or NI you will need to bring a copy of your valid USDOT Medical Examiners Certificate if it is not already on file with DMV. 
4. Can I change my self-certification driving type online? 
No , you must go into a DMV office. 
5. I am eligible for an excepted operation, but I have a valid DOT Medical Examiner s Certificate. What driving type should I certify to? 
You should certify to the type of driving in which you operate or expect to operate , and your CDL will have the restrictions for that driving type. Remember , your certification can be changed anytime at a local DMV office through a license amendment transaction. NOTE: If you are capable of obtaining a Medical Examiner s Certificate , then the NI driving type will allow for the broadest commercial operation capability with no license restrictions applied. 
6. I do not meet the USDOT federal medical requirements, and I cannot obtain a Medical Examiner s Certificate. I do not operate in any federal excepted operation, but I was able to keep my CDL because it was issued prior to 9/9/1999. Can I still keep my CDL license? 
Yes , you are eligible for Excepted Intrastate operation EA. You must ensure that your CDL has the required restrictions: K CDL Intrastate Only and A3 Med Cert Exempt. CDL holders that certify to EA can only operate a commercial motor vehicle within New York State, and cannot deliver cargo coming from, or being delivered to, another state or foreign country. 
7. I work for a "private" company that provides school bus service to local school systems. Do I need to provide a Medical Examiner s Certificate or can I certify to "EI"? 
If you operate or expect to operate in an excepted operation such as school operation for a private service , you can choose EI. School operation is defined as " school to home / home to school " operation and includes interstate operation for school operation only. This does not include field trips. Only applicants employed by a municipality can drive for out - of - state field trips. It is important to remember that when you choose driving type EI, you are limited to driving only for an excepted operation. NOTE: If you are capable of obtaining a Medical Examiner s Certificate , then the NI driving type will allow for the broadest commercial operation capability with no license restrictions applied. 
8. I have a current CDL license with no restrictions. I do NOT have a Medical Examiner s Certificate and I do not use my CDL license to drive commercially. For example I am retired, not working, etc. I don t want to downgrade my license because I paid for a CDL and have several years before it expires. What driving type should I choose? 
Federal regulations require all CDL drivers to certify to the type of driving in which they operate or expect to operate. You should choose the box which describes the type of driving that you perform or expect to perform. If you expect to operate in an excepted driving type EA or EI then a Medical Examiner s Certificate is not required. You will need to have the appropriate restrictions added to your driver s license A3 and/or K. If you expect to operate in a non - excepted driving type NA or NI then a Medical Examiner s Certificate is required. Remember , your certification can be changed anytime at a local DMV office through a license amendment transaction. 
9. Why did I receive my Medical Examiner s Certificate back in the mail with a rejection letter? 
The rejection letter indicates why the Medical Examiner s Certificate is being returned to you. If information was incorrect, missing or illegible , you must contact your physician to have the form amended or another form completed. If your Medical Examiners Certificate was rejected because it was not completed by a doctor listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners , you must have a new exam completed by a doctor on the registry. To find a certified doctor in your area please visit the Federal website at National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners Search [1]. 
10. If I downgrade my license to a non-commercial class, am I eligible for a refund? 
No refund will be given as the driver will have the remainder of the renewal period as well as the two year grace period to be granted back the CDL without re - testing requirements. A refund is only allowed by law if the license is surrendered in full and there is 4 years or more remaining at the time of surrender. 
11. Will you send me a reminder when my Medical Examiner s Certificate or my medical variance is going to expire? 
Yes , DMV sends reminders to CDL and CLP holders who have registered to receive email and/or text reminders about the status of their medical certifications [2] and medical variances [3]. To register to receive these reminders , go to Get email and/or text reminders [4]. Failure to submit an updated Medical Examiner s Certificate, or medical variance, prior to the expiration date of the one on file may result in your CDL being downgraded. You should allow at least two weeks to process your updated documents. 
12. The Medical Examiner s Certificate I previously sent has since expired or is due to expire. My next doctor s appointment is not for another two weeks. What happens to my CDL in the meantime? 
Once your Medical Examiner s Certificate on file expires , you are no longer certified to drive commercial vehicles. A notice advising you of your not certified medical status and impending license downgrade 56 days from the date of notice will be sent to you. When we receive your new updated medical certificate , you will be re - certified. If your CDL was downgraded because of your " not certified " medical status , you will need to visit a local DMV office to upgrade your license back to a CDL. 
13. How do I know that the DMV received my self-certification and/or Medical Examiner s Certificate information? 
If you are signed up for MyDMV or sign up at go to MyDMV [5] at the DMV website and use the service called " My License Status, Renewal and Replacement , " you can look under " License Status " to determine your self - certification driving type, medical certification status and medical certificate expiration date. If you self - certified to driving types NI & NA , you will have a medical certification status of either " Certified " or " Not Certified. " If you self - certified to EI or EA , you will have a medical certification status of " Not Required ". Note: DMV is entering commercial driver self - certification and medical certification data daily, as soon as possible. However , due to the volume of responses it could take a period of time for a driver record to be fully updated. Self - certification driving types data will be entered and show first, followed later by medical certification data , So , there may be a period of time where an NI or NA driving type reflects a " Not Certified " medical status until the medical certification data is entered, when it will then be updated to " Certified ". 
14. How can I contact the Medical Certification Unit? 
Fax : 518 - 486 - 4421 or 518 - 486 - 3260 Email : [ email protected] [6 ] Mail: NYS DMVMedical Certification UnitPO Box 2601Albany , NY 12220 - 0601

The traffic court fine could be as much as $1,500 for driving without insurance or allowing another person to drive your uninsured vehicle. You will also need to pay the DMV a $750 civil penalty to restore your driver license [3] if it is revoked.

title : Know Your Rights in Auto Repair#3
document : Smart Shopping for Auto RepairsYou can help avoid trouble with an unreliable or dishonest repair shop by following these tips : Deal only with a registered shop. Make sure there's a green and white " Registered State of New York Motor Vehicle Repair Shop " sign outside the shop and a valid New York State Department of Motor Vehicles DMV registration certificate inside. Use the " Find a DMV - regulated Business " service to find a registered repair shop in your area. Ask your family, friends and co - workers for advice on reliable repair shops in your area, as well as those you should avoid. Keep all records, including estimates, invoices, work orders, receipts, guarantees and warranties. Besides their importance in case you file a repair complaint , these papers serve as your record of service, and could increase your vehicle's resale value. If you authorize repair work by phone , write down the date and time, the name of the person you spoke with, any estimated price quoted, and other pertinent details. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Management of a shop should take the time to explain required repairs and prices, discuss problems, and tell you about the training and experience of employees. 
The "Consumer's Bill Of Rights" 
Under the Repair Shop Act , you have the following rights when dealing with a repair shop : Written Estimate If you request it , the repair shop must give you a written estimate of the parts and labor necessary for each specific repair. The shop may charge a reasonable fee for developing a written estimate , but the labor charge for an estimate may not exceed the shop's usual hourly labor charge . The estimate must list each part and its cost, and show what parts, if any, are either used or not of original quality. It must show the labor charges for each repair and by what method they are calculated. The shop may not charge more than the estimated price without your permission. Authorizing Work A shop may not perform any services unless you give your permission. If the shop prepares a written work order , it must give you a copy. If you prepare a written work order , the shop must attach it to the invoice. If work is authorized verbally or by telephone , the invoice must show the date, time, and name of the person giving authorization. Parts You are entitled to the return of all replaced parts, except warranty and exchange parts , but you must ask for them in writing before any work is done. If you authorize work by phone , the shop must keep any replaced parts, and make them available when you pick up the vehicle. Invoice When repairs are completed , the shop must give you a detailed invoice listing each repair done, each part replaced, the cost for each, and the cost of labor. The invoice must show which replacement parts, if any, are used, or not of original quality. It must show the odometer reading at the time you left the vehicle for repair and when the invoice was prepared. If the shop promised a delivery date , that must be listed on the repair order. If you received a written estimate , compare it with the invoice and try to resolve any questions before you pay for the repairs. Inspection After Repair You have the right to inspect your vehicle at the shop before paying for repairs. However , this does not give you the right to remove the vehicle from the shop without paying for the repairs, or to inspect it in areas where only authorized employees are allowed. Guarantees A shop is not required to guarantee its work , but if a shop voluntarily guarantees repairs, the terms and time limit of the guarantee must be listed on the invoice . If you are not satisfied with the quality or price of a repair, discuss it with the management of the shop. Many misunderstandings can be resolved through a calm, honest discussion. 
If You Have a Repair Problem 
First , attempt to resolve the issue with the management of the business. Keep a written record of all contacts with management in addition to details about the repair. Copies of work orders and invoices are proof of your attempts to resolve the problem . If a satisfactory resolution is not reached and you wish to file a complaint, you must submit a Vehicle Safety Complaint Report PDF [1] [1] along with any supporting documents to the DMV Consumer & Facilities Services Complaint Unit. To submit electronically , download the complaint report available at the link above to your personal device. Attach and then email the completed report as well as any supporting documents to [email protected] [2]. Please note that DMV staff will communicate with you through email. Complaint UnitBureau of Consumer & Facility ServicesDepartment of Motor VehiclesP.O. Box 2700-ESP , Albany , NY 12220 - 0700FAX : 518 486 - 4102Phone : 1 - 518 - 474 - 8943 between 8:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Monday - Friday Email : [ email protected] [2 ] IMPORTANT : DMV staff will not investigate a complaint until a completed VS-35 Complaint Report has been received. The department does not investigate complaints that have been filed anonymously. There is a 90-day limit on reporting incidents related to a NYS Repair Shop. We cannot accept complaints against Repair Shops beyond the 90-day limit or 3,000 miles whichever comes first. The DMV cannot resolve disputes over the terms of manufacturer or third party warranties or guarantees. If you feel you have a NYS Lemon Law complaint , please see Lemon Law Complaints [3]. 
What Happens to Your Complaint 
A DMV customer service representative will try to resolve the problem by discussing it with you and the shop. About half the complaints received by DMV are resolved through mediation . If the repair problem isn't resolved , your complaint will often be referred to a DMV regional office for investigation. A DMV inspector may contact you to ask questions or discuss your case in detail. These inspectors are experienced automotive technicians trained to investigate and resolve complaints . If the DMV investigation indicates the shop violated the Repair Shop Act or regulations, DMV will either send a warning letter to the shop or schedule a hearing. If a hearing determines there were violations , DMV will take action against the shop. This may include suspending or revoking the shop's registration and/or imposing fines . If you suffer a financial loss due to overcharging or unnecessary or poor quality repairs, the administrative law judge presiding at the hearing may offer the shop the option of paying restitution. The shop may then receive a shorter suspension period and/or a lower fine . DMV cannot force a shop to pay restitution. Restitution is limited to the amount you were overcharged or the cost of proper repairs. Other expenses, such as the cost of renting a replacement car, cannot be included. Filing a complaint with DMV does not prevent you from seeking help from other consumer protection agencies or from taking the shop to court. However , if you receive a court settlement or one is pending , restitution through DMV is not available. 
With Your Help, The Repair Shop Act Works 
Under the Repair Shop Act , thousands of dollars are returned to consumers each year through mediation and restitution. In addition , hundreds of vehicles are repaired at no additional cost. The Repair Shop Act also helps to make our highways safer by promoting quality auto repairs . The Repair Shop Act works best when consumers take the time to shop wisely for auto repairs, keep records of their dealings with shops, and discuss repairs with shop management to avoid misunderstandings.

The law applies to all vehicles sold at any selling price and which display any odometer reading. The vehicle must be acceptable for use on the road at the time of sale. 
Temporary registration expiring soon 
If you cannot get the title certificate for a vehicle you sold and the temporary registration expires soon , you cannot get another temporary registration. According to the DMV Commissioner's Regulations , you cannot sell a vehicle if you do not have proof of ownership. You cannot issue an additional temporary registration under any circumstances. 
Surety bond 
To get a surety bond , you must contact a surety insurance company. Make sure that the business name and mailing address on the bond exactly match the business name and mailing address on your DMV facility license. Make sure that you write your Facility Number on the bond. 
Bond amount required from a dealer 
The bond amount depends on the number of vehicles the dealer sold in the previous calendar year, or if the dealer is licensed as a franchised new dealer. Refer to the chart below

title : Sharing your information#3
document : 
Does DMV sell driver license and vehicle information to others? 
Yes. DMV makes driver license and vehicle registration information available for a fee using three methods: contract sales, pay - per - search and over - the - counter. Anyone who accesses DMV information must comply with the federal Driver s Privacy Protection Act [1] DPPA. The DPPA was enacted by Congress after a careful debate about why states should be allowed to share DMV data. The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver s personal information to anyone who does not have what the DPPA considers a permissible use. The DPPA defines personal information as an individual s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address, telephone number and medical information. Information on crashes, driving violations, and driver's status is not considered personal information. Social security numbers are sold. 
1. Contract Sales 
In accordance with the federal DPPA and NY State law , DMV sells registration and vehicle data through an open procurement process every two years. The successful bidders cannot use DMV information for any purposes other than those in connection with the issuance of a manufacturer s warranty, safety recall or similar notices important things that keep the public safe. The data can be used for statistical compilations and analysis, which do not contain any personal, identifying information. The DMV does not permit successful bidders to use the data for surveys, marketing, or solicitations. DMV collects approximately $2.2 million per year from contract sales. 
2. Pay-Per-Search 
To access DMV data for legitimate DPPA purposes DMV offers a pay - per - search service. In accordance with NY State law , anyone requesting access using this method must apply to DMV and sign an agreement identifying their permissible use under the DPPA. Upon verification and approval of their application , a search account is established for the requestor. The majority of search account holders are insurance companies, who must rate and monitor drivers, and investigate claims, and employers who are required to monitor their employees driving records. Each search costs $7 and is logged by DMV. Search account holders must have a DPPA permissible use for every search performed , and DMV monitors their compliance through an audit program. DMV collects approximately $58 million per year from pay - per - search sales. 
3. Over-the-counter 
Anyone can visit a State or County DMV office to purchase a driver license record as long as the requestor provides sufficient and specific information that identifies one and only one record, and provides a DPPA permissible use. Each over - the - counter search is $10. DMV collects approximately $3.0 million per year from over - the - counter sales. 
The benefits of sharing DMV information 
The DMV information shared with bus companies, employers, insurance companies, researchers, and motor vehicle manufacturers, through each of the three sharing methods, makes our lives safer and more convenient. If this information were not made available traffic safety and commerce would be negatively impacted. A few examples of how DMV s information sharing programs benefit all of us are provided below. 
School Bus Drivers 
School districts and private school bus companies are required to know about their drivers driving history before they hire them to transport children and other passengers. Access to DMV information enables school bus companies to make informed decisions about whom to hire. Once hired , DMV requires bus operators to conduct regular searches of their drivers records to confirm nothing negative happens during their employment that would impact their ability to safely continue to drive school buses. 
Hazardous Materials Drivers 
This same scenario applies to businesses transporting hazardous materials. All of us want to know the driver of a vehicle hauling dangerous materials is qualified to drive, properly trained, and possesses a valid Commercial Driver License CDL. NY State laws require hazardous material companies to only hire and employ drivers who are qualified and have valid licenses. Employers must regularly obtain their employees license records from DMV. 
Insurance Companies 
When you are shopping for automobile insurance on - line , you expect a rate quote within minutes. Insurance companies are able to provide this convenient service because they have direct pay - per - search access to DMV information. They check your driving history to issue an immediate rate quote. If companies could not conduct these searches , insurance companies would require you to purchase your driver record and send it to them before issuing you a quote. This practice would make it more difficult for customers to shop for affordable rates, and could increase the potential for fraudulently altered or unreliable driver records. 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
Purchasing a used car does not automatically register you as an owner of that vehicle with the manufacturer. Manufacturers rely on DMV s contract sales program to find and notify current owners of vehicles affected by safety recalls. Recalls do not only jeopardize the safety of the owner / operator of the affected vehicle , they could also affect the safety of every other person sharing the road with that potentially unsafe vehicle. These are just a few examples of how DMV s information sharing programs are critical to improving public safety and making everyone s life more convenient.

We need both. You must register your vehicle within 180 days of the effective date on your Insurance ID Card. Bring one copy or form of your Insurance ID Card with you. The DMV office will keep the paper card. Keep the other paper card with the vehicle as your proof of insurance. Anyone operating your vehicle must be able to provide proof of insurance. Learn more about NY State Insurance Requirements [9]. You must be at least 16 years old except for ATV registrations. A NY State Driver License, Learner Permit, or Non - Driver ID card that is current or not expired for more than 2 years can serve as proof of both identity and age . If you don t have one of these, see other kinds of proof [10] you can use. Most states allow a non - resident to register a vehicle. It can be easier to apply for a vehicle registration and title certificate in the other state. If you are traveling and your registration expires , you should determine if the other state can issue an " in - transit " permit, which allows you to transport a vehicle to New York so that you can register it. Definition of New York State Resident Section 250 5 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law defines the term' resident. ' The law defines a resident as a person who lives in NY State with the intent to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " place to live. To live in a house, a home, an apartment, a room or other similar place in NY State for 90 days is considered " presumptive evidence " that you are a resident of NY State. A police officer can use this evidence as the reason to issue a traffic ticket if you drive in NY State without a driver license or vehicle registration issued by NY State. A judge considers the law and the evidence of your intent and decides if you are a resident of NY State. For example , if you pay taxes or your children attend school in another state , a judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " residence. The DMV will not decide if you are a resident of NY State, if you must get a NY State driver license, or if you must register your vehicle in NY State. According to this law , students from other states or from other nations who attend school in NY State are normally not considered residents of NY State.

title : Point & Insurance Reduction Program#3
document : The Point & Insurance Reduction Program PIRP, approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles, is available through private companies or corporations, called " course sponsors, " throughout New York State. Each qualifying course must meet strict standards for the safe driving information presented and program effectiveness. If you complete an approved PIRP course : It will help refresh your driving knowledge with a review of time - tested safe driving tips and an overview of today's vehicle and traffic laws. You may be eligible to reduce as many as four 4 points on your driving record. The DMV computer will automatically note your eligibility to receive the reduction. If you are the principal operator of a motor vehicle , you will receive a minimum 10% reduction in the base rate of your automobile and motorcycle liability and collision insurance premiums each year for three years. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT... 

The Course 
How much time does the PIRP course take, what is it like and what does it cost? Beginning in 2009 , you will have two options for completing the PIRP course. Your options will be the traditional classroom method or an Alternate Delivery Method ADM, such as the Internet or other DMV approved method. Regardless of the delivery method , each course is at least six hours long. Note: The motorcycle safety / accident prevention courses take substantially longer and are only available in a classroom setting. Essential information about traffic safety issues such as driver attitude and behavior, defensive driving techniques, and the Vehicle & Traffic Law must be presented in each course. For both the classroom and ADM methods , additional content, approach, materials and fees vary from one sponsor to the next. Information specific to the classroom course : The course is presented in one or more classroom sessions and attendance is mandatory. No formal testing is required to complete the course. For information on where to attend a course , consult your local telephone book under " Driving Instruction " or equivalent sections. You may also contact one of the program sponsors presented in the DMV publication, " List of Course Sponsors " C-31, available at any state or county motor vehicle office and by request from DMV Call Center. The information is also available on the department website: dmv.ny.gov [1]. Information specific to the alternate delivery method : The course will be a minimum 320 minutes. Once you register with a sponsor , you have up to 30 days to complete the course. During the course , you will be asked to identify yourself with information given at registration. To ensure that you are taking the course , you will also be asked questions regarding the content. It is possible that you will be asked to register in person and/or take an exam at the end to once again ensure you are the one who completed the course. Each sponsor's method is different , so you should contact the sponsor to determine which course best fits your needs. You can contact approved ADM course sponsors presented in the DMV publication, " List of Course Sponsors [2] " C-31, available at any state or county motor vehicle office and by request from the DMV Call Center. The most up - to - date information regarding who is approved to provide the alternate delivery method is available on the department website: dmv.ny.gov [1]. 
Point Reduction 
After I complete the PIRP course , how do I receive the point reduction? The PIRP sponsor will notify the DMV within ten weeks after you complete the course. A notice will then be entered on your driving record , and the DMV computer will automatically reduce your active point total by up to four points. Important : Completion of a course under the " Point & Insurance Reduction Program " does not remove, delete, subtract, or erase any violation, conviction, or notice of original number of points from your driving record. Even after you complete the course , most violations, conviction and points assessed will continue to show on your driving record for up to four years. Violations and convictions involving drugs or alcohol will remain on your driving record for ten or fifteen years, depending on the violation. " Point reduction " means the DMV will not count up to four points on your driving record toward license revocation or suspension. How do I know my driving record shows my PIRP course completion? If you need to verify the course completion has been entered on your record , you may request a copy of your driving record from the DMV. To do so , you can order your driving record online [3], or complete a Request for Driver and/or Vehicle Record Information [4] MV-15. This form is available on the DMV website at dmv.ny.gov [1] or at any motor vehicle office. If your course completion is not noted on your driving record more than ten weeks after you completed it , contact the course sponsor. What effect does point reduction have on my license and driving record? Point reduction applies only to points assessed for violations that occurred within the eighteen months immediately before course completion. It does not affect points for earlier violations, and cannot be used as " credit " against future violations or points. Point reduction cannot reduce your point total lower than zero. If your license has already been revoked or suspended, or if a violation hearing has already been scheduled , point reduction will not affect that action. Point reduction does not prevent or cancel a mandatory revocation or suspension for violations such as DWI, DWAI, or three speeding violations within 18 months. Points may be reduced only once in any 18-month period. The DMV point system and insurance company " point " systems are separate and not related. Point reduction on your driving record does not affect points assigned by your insurance company for violations and accidents. Completion of a course under the " Point & Insurance Reduction Program " also cannot prevent or reduce the calculation of points affecting a " Driver Responsibility Assessment. " The most recent information about the Driver Responsibility Assessment [5] program is available from the DMV web site. 
Insurance Reduction 
After completing the PIRP course , how do I receive the insurance reduction? The course sponsor should mail you a completion certificate within 45 days after you complete the course. If you present your certificate to your insurance company or agent within 90 days after course completion , your liability and collision premium reduction will begin immediately, retroactive to the date you completed the course. If you present your certificate more than 90 days after course completion , the insurer may issue the premium discount effective from the date presented. If you do not receive your certificate within eight weeks after completion , immediately contact the program sponsor. You may take the course once every 36 months to maintain insurance reduction benefits. Will the PIRP course prevent my insurance company from raising my premiums? No. Insurance reduction does not prevent general premium increases, or premium increases due to violations or accidents. It provides a 10% reduction for three years, from the base rate of your current liability, no - fault and collision premiums. What if more than one person named on a policy completes the PIRP course? The insurance premium reduction applies to all motor vehicles principally operated by the motorist who completes the course. The reduction can be applied to only one driver for each covered vehicle. Will youthful operators and drivers participating in assigned risk pool receive the insurance premium discount? Yes. Any insured driver who is the principal operator and completes a Point & Insurance Reduction Program course will receive the reduction. If a youthful operator is already receiving a driver education reduction , will the PIRP discount also be applied? Check with your insurance company or agent to find out if both reductions will be given at the same time. 
DMV Point System Summary 
The following table shows the point values assigned to moving traffic violations. The " points " are assessed against your driving record based on the date you committed the violation, not the date you were convicted in court. If you accumulate 11 or more points in 18 months , you will be called to a DMV hearing, after which your license may be suspended or revoked. You will be offered the option of waiving the hearing or accepting a definite period of suspension. Some license revocations and suspensions are mandatory and do not depend on points. These include three speeding violations within 18 months, and convictions involving alcohol or drugs. For more information about license suspensions and revocations , please refer to the publication Suppose Your License Were Taken Away [6] C-12, available at any motor vehicle office.

Both names must appear on the Insurance ID Card. 
Do I need insurance to register my vehicle? 
Yes. The DMV requires auto liability insurance to register a vehicle in New York. When you get insurance , your insurance company will issue proof of insurance in two ways. It will give you two original NY State Insurance ID Cards see a sample [3] or provide you with access to your digital electronic NY State Insurance ID Card 3 send an electronic notice of insurance coverage to the DMV your insurance agent or broker cannot file this notice Your NY State Insurance Identification Cards and the electronic notice of insurance together verify your insurance coverage. We need both. You must register your vehicle at the DMV within 180 days of the effective date on your insurance ID card. Bring one copy or form of your Insurance Identification Cards with you. The DMV office will keep the paper card. Keep the other paper card with the vehicle as your proof of insurance.

We will never accept out - of - state vehicle insurance coverage of any type. If your vehicle is registered in New York , it must have New York State auto liability insurance coverage. Your motorcycle must have insurance coverage any time it is operated on a public road or highway. Unlike most other motor vehicles, motorcycles are registered for one year rather than two , and all motorcycle registrations expire on April 30.

However , under no circumstances may your motorcycle operate on public highways without liability coverage in effect. A change on the insurance policy to a name different from the name on your registration may cause a lapse in insurance coverage , and DMV may suspend your driver license and your vehicle registration.

title : Renew a hazardous materials (HazMat) endorsement#1
document : 
Renew a hazardous materials (HazMat) endorsement [1] 

How do I renew my hazardous materials (HazMat) endorsement? 
We will normally mail you a renewal notice for your HazMat endorsement, which is separate from the notice to renew your CDL. Follow the instructions in the HazMat endorsement renewal notice to apply for the background checks. 
How often do I need to get a background check? 
To keep the HazMat endorsement , the driver must provide fingerprints and pass the background checks every five years. 
How do I provide my fingerprints for the background check? 
The required fingerprinting service is being provided by Identogo. All HazMat endorsement applicants must be fingerprinted at one of the Identogo ID centers located throughout New York State. 2 3 Fingerprinting is done by appointment only. You must contact Identogo to select a fingerprinting location and schedule an appointment. Visit https://uenroll.identogo.com [2] or by calling 1 - 877 - 472 - 6915. Attain Fingerprinting Services Information [3] HAZ-600 to make your appointment. Bring your NYS CDL and one of the second proofs of ID that are listed on form HAZ-600. 
How long will the background checks take? 
Background checks can take 30 days or more to complete. If your endorsement expires , it will not be restored until the criminal history background checks are completed and you have been re - qualified by both the TSA and the DMV. 
How will I be notified of the results? 
The Federal Transportation Security Administration TSA will notify you by mail of the results of the background check based on federal standards only. The TSA website [4] has information about the federal background checks for the HazMat endorsements. Please do not request the results of background checks from the DMV, Identogo, or the TSA. Wait to receive the notifications in the mail. 
Can I get a temporary HazMat endorsement before the background checks are complete? 
No. We cannot issue the HazMat endorsement until the background checks are completed and approved. We will provide a CDL with the HazMat endorsement that is valid for 90 days only if you applied to renew a current NYS CDL with a HazMat endorsement , and the background checks are not completed and approved before the endorsement expires. 
Do I need to take another written test? 
To keep your HazMat endorsement , you must pass the test again within two years before your CDL expires. You can take the test when you apply to renew your CDL , or you can take the test up to two years before the expiration date of your CDL. 4If you need to take the test , you can study the hazardous materials section of the NYS Commercial Driver License Manual CDL-10, or study the Hazardous Materials Manual CDL-11. 
What if I do not pass the written test or the background checks? 
If you do not pass the written test or the background checks , the DMV will issue a CDL that does not have a HazMat endorsement . It is important that a driver whose address has changed promptly file a change of address with the NYS DMV. See Address Change for more information. 
What if I no longer need the HazMat endorsement? 
If you do not need a HazMat endorsement , do not take the written test and do not apply for the background checks. When it is time to renew your CDL , follow the instructions provided with your CDL renewal notice and pay the CDL renewal fee. The DMV will issue a CDL that does not have a HazMat endorsement. Federal and State laws require fingerprint - based background checks for anyone who wants a hazardous materials endorsement, to determine whether that person has a criminal history and/or poses a security threat that warrants denying him or her the authorization to transport hazardous materials. No hazardous materials endorsement may be issued, transferred or renewed unless the background checks result in a determination by the Federal Transportation Security Administration TSA and New York State that the person applying for the endorsement is authorized to transport hazardous materials. To initiate background checks , the rules require that the applicant be fingerprinted, and that his or her United States citizenship or permanent legal presence in the United States be verified. The background checks include a check of criminal history data from the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI. There is also a background check by the federal Transportation Safety Administration TSA. You must provide fingerprints even if you provided fingerprints for another application, for example for a pistol permit or employment as a security guard. You must provide fingerprints for an H endorsement or an X endorsement on your CDL. You must answer 80% or more of the questions correctly to pass the test. You can take the test as many times as necessary until you pass the test , but you must pay a $5 fee for each test you take. 
Do it by phone: 
You can't renew a HazMat endorsement by phone. You can call or email the HazMat unit with questions at 1 - 518 - 408 - 2997 or [email protected] [5 ]

What should I practice for my road test? 
Steering: Steer smoothly whether you are driving straight ahead, turning or backing up. Acceleration : Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Don't race the engine or cause it to stall. Braking : Bring the vehicle to a stop gently. Start braking well before your stopping position to avoid abrupt stops. Make sure you stop your vehicle in the proper position of the lane. Clutch / Gears : Always be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. With either an automatic or a manual transmission , shift into the proper gear at the right time without " grinding " the gears. Speed: Obey the posted speed limit, of course, but also adjust your speed properly due to weather, road, visibility and traffic conditions. Following distance : Keep an adequate space " cushion " between your vehicle and those you are following. Use the " two second rule " described in the Driver's Manual. Be sure to increase your following distance in poor weather or visibility. Traffic signs, signals and markings : Know the meanings of signs, signals and pavement markings, and obey them consistently. Stopping position : If a stop is required , stop your vehicle before it reaches an intersecting street. If stop lines or crosswalks are present , stop before crossing them. If your view is blocked after stopping behind the crosswalk , move up until you can clearly see your way , then stop again if necessary. Lane selection and position : Keep your vehicle in the proper traffic lane, especially when preparing to make turns. Don't allow room for another vehicle to pass you on the side that you are turning toward. Communication : Let other drivers and pedestrians know which way you want to go. Use your directional signals or horn consistently and at the proper times. Observation : Look for and identify potential problems or hazards in the traffic around you - not just straight ahead, but behind you and on either side. Check your mirrors frequently , but be sure to look over your shoulder behind you when changing lanes or backing up. Anticipate and react : Anticipate possible driving errors by others and be ready to react safely to make up for their mistakes. If you have a Class DJ or MJ learner permit , you must have a minimum of 50 hours of supervised practice driving that includes at least 15 hours of driving after sunset before you take a road test. You must bring to the road test a completed Certification of Supervised Driving [3] MV-262 signed by your parent or guardian. If you lose your certificate , contact the school that issued it to obtain a replacement.

title : New CDL testing and commercial learner permit (CLP) standards#3
document : 
Overview 
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA [1] has amended commercial driver license standards. This regulation is referred to as the' CDL Permit Rule' and mandated compliance by July 8 , 2015. The New York State DMV implemened the rules in phases, from April through July of 2015. We refer to the Commercial Learner Permit as " CLP ", and the Commercial Driver License as " CDL. " The changes are listed in order of implementation by the New York State DMV. 
Phase 1 - April 2015 

CDL skills testing changes 
When you schedule or update a CDL Skills Test road test appointment , you will not be able to schedule an appointment within the first 14 days from the issuance of the CLP. 
National suspension and revocation screening 
The CDL Permit Rule broadens the criteria used during CLP and CDL license applications to check for open suspensions and revocations in other states. New York State will reject any application where a driver has any open suspension or revocation in any state. 
Phase 2 - May 2015 

Medical Certification changes 
The New York State DMV will send CLP holders a notification if their medical certification status becomes " Not Certified. " Once we send the notification , we will cancel the CLP if the CLP holder does not re - certify within 55 days. We can send employers a notification of these status changes if they subscribe to the NY State License Event Notification Service LENS [2]. We will send passenger carriers enrolled in the 19-A system notifications of CLP cancellation events. 
Phase 3 - June 2015 

Endorsement and restriction changes 
New CDL restrictions defined below by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA may affect CLP holders when taking a Skills Test in a vehicle without full airbrakes and/or a manual transmission. E - No Manual Transmission Equipped CMV L - No Airbrake Equipped CMV Z - No Full Airbrake Equipped CMV restrictions If the vehicle used for your skills test has : An automatic transmission , and this is your first road test in a commercial motor vehicle CMV , you will be given an E restriction. No form of airbrakes , and this is your first road test in a CMV , you will be given an L restriction. If you have a CDL with an L restriction and you test in a vehicle with air over hydraulic brakes , you will be upgraded from an L to a Z restriction. Also , please note that : CLPs will no longer be issued with the Double / Triple Trailer T endorsement. The T endorsement can be issued only to a driver holding a CDL. CLPs issued with a Passenger P or School Bus S endorsement will automatically get a new federally mandated " No Passengers in CMV Bus " P restriction. CLPs issued with a Tank Vehicles N endorsement will automatically get a federally mandated " No Cargo in CMV Tank Vehicle " X restriction. The P and X restrictions are issued for the CLP only. The CDL that is issued after all required tests have been passed will not have the P or X restrictions. The CDL Permit Rule added 5 new restrictions, which required New York State to change the letter assigned to existing restrictions. These restriction changes go into effect June 4 , 2015. We will send drivers a new CLP and/or CDL document with these changes printed on them after their next CLP or CDL application. 
Application requirement changes

Make Sure Your FAFSA Form Was Processed 
After you submit your FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid mobile app , you can check its status immediately. (Note: Only the student can check the status, because the FSA ID username and password are required to log in.) Here s how: Go to fafsa.gov or the myStudentAid mobile app and log in with your FSA ID username and password. The status of your application will be one of the following. Processing : Your application is still processing. It typically takes three to five days, plus one additional business day to be made available to the schools you listed on the form. Processed Successfully : Your application was processed successfully. No further action is needed. Missing Signatures : Your application is missing the required signature. Action Required : Your application requires further action. Contact your school to resolve the issue. If you submitted a paper FAFSA form , you can check its status after it has been processed roughly 7 10 days from the date mailed. You can also contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center to find out if your FAFSA application was processed. 
Understand the Full Impact of Your FAFSA Application 
Not only is your FAFSA form an application for federal student aid , it also is used in determining your eligibility for certain state and school financial aid. Your FAFSA information is shared with the colleges and/or career schools you list on the application. The financial aid office at a school uses your information to figure out how much aid you may receive at that school. Note: The school might also have other forms for you to fill out to get school aid, so check with the financial aid office to be sure. Your information also goes to your state higher education agency, as well as to agencies of the states where your chosen schools are located. Many states have financial aid funds that they give out based on FAFSA information. 
Review Your Student Aid Report (SAR) 
The SAR is a summary of the FAFSA data you submitted. You the student will get your SAR within three days to three weeks after you submit your FAFSA form. Look over your SAR carefully, make sure you didn t make a mistake on your FAFSA form, and make corrections to your FAFSA data if necessary. Find out more about the SAR, its purpose, how the method you use to file your FAFSA form determines when you ll get the SAR, and what you should do with the SAR. 
What Not to Expect from the SAR 
The SAR won t tell you how much financial aid you ll get. Also , if you used the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT when filling out your FAFSA form , the SAR won t show the details of your income and tax information. 
So how do you find out how much aid you ll get? 
If you ve been accepted at a college or career school that you listed on your FAFSA form , the school will calculate your aid and send you an electronic or paper aid offer, sometimes called an award letter, telling you how much aid you re eligible for at the school. The timing of the aid offer varies from school to school and could be as early as winter awarding for the fall or as late as immediately before you start school. It depends on when you apply and how the school prefers to schedule awarding of aid. 
Provide Required Verification 
You might see a note on your SAR saying you ve been selected for verification ; or your school might contact you to inform you that you ve been selected. Verification is the process your school uses to confirm that the data reported on your FAFSA form is accurate. If you re selected for verification , your school will request additional documentation that supports the information you reported. Don t assume you re being accused of doing anything wrong. Some people are selected for verification at random ; and some schools verify all students' FAFSA forms. All you need to do is provide the documentation your school asks for and be sure to do so by the school s deadline , or you won t be able to get financial aid. If you used the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT when filling out your FAFSA form , you may not have to verify that information. In the following cases , however , your school may require you to submit an IRS tax transcript or a signed copy of your income tax return as part of the verification process. You didn t use the IRS DRT. You used the IRS DRT and reported rollovers. You used the IRS DRT but also amended your tax return. You can find your tax transcript through the IRS s Get Transcript service at irs.gov/transcript. 
Correct Mistakes or Make Updates to Your FAFSA Form 

Correct Mistakes 
Once your application has been processed , you can correct your FAFSA form online or on paper. 
Make Updates 
While most information cannot be changed on the FAFSA form , some information must be updated if it changes. Find out the difference and how to update FAFSA information. NOTE : Making corrections or updates online requires the student to sign in using his or her FSA ID username and password. The parent cannot sign in and make changes to the form. 
Decide What Aid to Accept 
First , you ll need to understand the aid that s being offered. For instance , is it free money such as a grant or scholarship , or is it a loan that you ll have to pay back? Next , decide what aid you really need, and then respond to the school s aid offer within the deadline set by the school. Learn more about accepting aid. 
Learn How Your Aid Is Paid Out 
If you were offered financial aid and you accepted it , the financial aid staff at your college or career school will explain exactly how and when your aid will be paid out. They ll also tell you whether you need to fill out any more paperwork or meet other requirements. For instance , if you re receiving a federal student loan for the first time , you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counseling. Be sure to keep in touch with your school s financial aid office so that you understand the whole process of receiving your aid. 

title : How Aid Is Calculated | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Wondering how the amount of your federal student aid is determined? 
The colleges or career schools you list on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form will use several pieces of information to calculate your aid. So, you ve filed your FAFSAform, and you ve checked your Student Aid Report to be sure all your information is correct , and now you re wondering how that data is used to come up with the list of financial aid for which you re eligible. 
If I meet the basic eligibility criteria for federal student aid, who decides how much money I ll get? 
Here s the short answer : Your eligibility depends on your Expected Family Contribution, your year in school, your enrollment status, and the cost of attendance at the school you will be attending. The financial aid office at your college or career school will determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive. The financial aid staff starts by deciding upon your cost of attendance COA at that school. They then consider your Expected Family Contribution EFC. They subtract your EFC from your COA to determine the amount of your financial need and therefore how much need - based aid you can get. To determine how much non - need - based aid you can get , the school takes your cost of attendance and subtracts any financial aid you ve already been awarded. If you d like the long answer , keep reading! 
What does cost of attendance (COA) mean? 
Your COA is the amount it will cost you to go to school. Most two - year and four - year colleges will calculate your COA to show your total cost for the school year for instance, for the fall semester plus the spring semester. Schools with programs that last a different period of time for instance, an 18-month certificate program might give you a COA that covers a time period other than a year. If you're attending at least half - time , your COA is the estimate of tuition and fees; the cost of room and board or living expenses for students who do not contract with the school for room and board ; the cost of books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and miscellaneous expenses including a reasonable amount for the documented cost of a personal computer ; an allowance for child care or other dependent care ; costs related to a disability ; and/or reasonable costs for eligible study - abroad programs. 
What s the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)? 
Your EFC is an index number that college financial aid staff use to determine how much financial aid you would receive if you were to attend their school. The information you report on your FAFSA form is used to calculate your EFC. The EFC is calculated according to a formula established by law. Your family's taxed and untaxed income, assets, and benefits such as unemployment or Social Security all could be considered in the formula. Also considered are your family size and the number of family members who will attend college or career school during the year. The EFC Formula guide shows exactly how an EFC is calculated. 
What is need-based aid and how does my school figure out how much I ll get? 
Your college or career school first determines whether you have financial need by using this simple formula : Calculating Your Financial Need Cost of Attendance COA Expected Family Contribution EFC = Financial Need Need - based aid is financial aid that you can receive if you have financial need and meet other eligibility criteria. You can t receive more need - based aid than the amount of your financial need. For instance , if your COA is $16,000 and your EFC is 12000 , your financial need is $4,000 ; so you aren t eligible for more than $4,000 in need - based aid. The following are the need - based federal student aid programs : Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant FSEOG Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Perkins Loan Federal Work-Study 
What is non-need-based aid and how does my school figure out how much I ll get? 
Your school determines how much non - need - based aid you can get by using this formula : Calculating Your Non - need - based Aid Cost of Attendance COA Financial Aid Awarded So Far * = Eligibility for Non - need - based Aid * includes aid from all sources, such as the school, private scholarship providers, etc. Non - need - based aid is financial aid that is not based on your EFC. What matters is your COA and how much other assistance you ve been awarded so far. For instance , if your COA is $16,000 and you ve been awarded a total of $4,000 in need - based aid and private scholarships , you can get up to $12,000 in non - need - based aid. The following are the non - need - based federal student aid programs : Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal PLUS Loan Teacher Education Access for College and Higher Education TEACH Grant

Student Loan Repayment 
Before repayment begins , develop a plan that puts you on track to pay back your loan on time and in full. Understanding the details of repayment on your federal student loan can save you time and money. Find out what repayment plan options are available , when you must begin making payments , how to make your payment , how to pay your loan off faster , and what to do if you have trouble making payments.

I need more information about the types of repayment plans available. 
Learn more about Repayment Plans. When You Must Begin Payments The Grace Period Making Payments Having Your Student Loan Forgiven REMEMBER : Your federal student loans can t be canceled or forgiven because you didn t get the education or job you expected or you didn t complete your education unless you couldn t complete your education because your school closed. 
When You Must Begin Payments 
Once you graduate , drop below half - time enrollment , or leave school , your federal student loan goes into repayment. However , if you have a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan , you have a six - month grace period before you are required to start making regular payments. You ll have a nine - month grace period if you ve got a Perkins Loan. (Got a PLUS loan? You ll go into repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed which means once it s paid out. But if you re a graduate and professional student PLUS borrower, you will be placed on an automatic deferment while in school and for six months after graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment.) Note: When your loan enters repayment , your servicer will automatically place you on the Standard Repayment Plan. You can request a different repayment plan at any time. You can make prepayments on your loan while you are in school or during your grace period. Be aware, however, that any prepayment you make will not count as a qualifying payment in any loan forgiveness programs. Your loan servicer will provide you with a loan repayment schedule that states when your first payment is due, the number and frequency of payments, and the amount of each payment. Your billing statement will tell you how much to pay. Your monthly payment amount depends on your repayment plan. If you signed up for electronic communication , pay attention to your email. Most loan servicers send an email when your billing statement is ready for you to access online. 
The Grace Period 
For most federal student loan types , after you graduate , leave school , or drop below half - time enrollment , you have a six - month grace period sometimes nine months for Perkins Loans before you must begin making payments. This grace period gives you time to get financially settled and to select your repayment plan. Not all federal student loans have a grace period. Note that for most loans, interest accrues during your grace period. You can choose to pay the interest that accrues during your grace period. This prevents that interest from being added to the principal balance also known as interest capitalization. 
Loans and Their Grace Periods 
Review this list to find out whether your loan has a grace period. Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have a six - month grace period before payments are due. PLUS loans do not have a grace period ; but if you received a PLUS loan as a graduate or professional student, you ll automatically get a six - month deferment after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half - time enrollment. No payments are required during this six - month deferment period. If you re a parent borrower who took out a PLUS loan to pay for your child s education , you can request a six - month deferment after your child graduates, leaves school, or drops below half - time enrollment. Contact your loan servicer for more information. If you received a Federal Perkins Loan , check with the school where you received your loan. 
Circumstances That May Affect Your Grace Period 
Certain situations that may affect your grace period include the following : Active duty military If you are called to active military duty for more than 30 days before the end of your grace period , you will receive the full six - month grace period when you return from active duty. Returning to school before the end of your loan s grace period If you reenroll in school at least half - time before the end of your grace period , you will receive the full six - month grace period when you stop attending school or drop below half - time enrollment. Loan consolidation If you consolidate your loans during your grace period , you give up the remainder of your grace period and begin repayment after your Direct Consolidation Loan is processed unless you request to have the processing of your consolidation loan delayed until closer to the end of your grace period. 
Making Payments 
The U.S. Department of Education ED uses several loan servicers to handle the billing and other services on loans for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program and for loans that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program and that ED later purchased. Your loan servicer will set you up under the Standard Repayment Plan unless you tell your loan servicer you want a different repayment plan. If you schedule an automatic monthly electronic debit of your loan payment from your checking or savings account , you receive a 0.25% interest rate deduction on Direct Loans. Contact your loan servicer for more information. To make a payment by postal mail , contact your loan servicer for the mailing address. To discuss repayment plan options or change your repayment plan , contact your loan servicer. First , though , you can use our Loan Simulator to get an early look at which plans you may be eligible for and see estimates for how much you would pay monthly and overall. 
I want to get ahead by paying extra each month. 
You can make payments before they are due or pay more than the amount due each month. Paying a little extra each month can reduce the interest you pay and reduce the total cost of your loan over time. Contact your loan servicer to discuss these options. 
I m having trouble making my loan payment. 
Contact your loan servicer as soon as possible. You may be able to change your repayment plan to one that lowers your monthly payment and, in some cases, may be based on your income. You can also ask your loan servicer about your options for a deferment or forbearance or loan consolidation. Trouble Making Your Federal Student Loan Payments? provides information on what to do if you are having difficulty making your student loan payments. 
I ve missed one or more loan payments. 
Stay in touch with your loan servicer especially if you are struggling to make payments on your loans. Your loan servicer will explain your repayment options, such as applying for an income - driven repayment plan or a forbearance or deferment, to help you stay on track or get back on track when you fall behind. One thing you definitely want to avoid is going into default! This occurs when you are at least nine months past due on your student loan. The consequences of default include damage to your credit rating and future borrowing ability. They may also include garnishment of your wages and withholding of your tax refunds. If you can t make payments , contact your loan servicer to find out your options. 
Having Your Student Loan Forgiven 
You are generally required to repay your student loan , but in certain situations, your loan may be forgiven, canceled, or discharged.

title : Income-Driven Repayment Plans | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
If your federal student loan payments are high compared to your income, you may want to repay your loans under an income-driven repayment plan. 
Most federal student loans are eligible for at least one income - driven repayment plan. If your income is low enough , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. An income - driven repayment plan sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable based on your income and family size. We offer four income - driven repayment plans : Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan REPAYE Plan Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan PAYE Plan Income - Based Repayment Plan IBR Plan Income - Contingent Repayment Plan ICR Plan If you d like to repay your federal student loans under an income - driven plan , you need to fill out an application. Why pay for help with your federal student loans when your loan servicer will help you for FREE? Contact your servicer to apply for income - driven repayment plans, student loan forgiveness, and more. Learn more about loan servicers. If you're seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you should repay your federal student loans under an income - driven repayment plan. Try This Resource Federal Student Loans : Repaying Your Loans Provides information about federal student loan repayment plan options, finding loan history and loan servicers, and making payments. 
How is my monthly payment amount calculated under an income-driven repayment plan? 
Generally , your payment amount under an income - driven repayment plan is a percentage of your discretionary income. The percentage is different depending on the plan. The chart below shows how payment amounts are determined under each income - driven plan. Depending on your income and family size , you may have no monthly payment at all. * For the IBR Plan , you're considered a new borrower on or after July 1 , 2014, if you had no outstanding balance on a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loan or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan on or after July 1 , 2014. Because no new FFEL Program loans have been made since June 30 , 2010, only Direct Loan borrowers can qualify as new borrowers on or after July 1 , 2014. 
How do I estimate my payment amount? 
Use our Loan Simulator. Loan Simulator provides a comparison of estimated monthly payment amounts for all federal student loan repayment plans, including income - driven plans. This comparison is important because the income - driven plans may not provide you with the lowest payment amount based on your individual circumstances. Your payment may be lower under another repayment plan. 
How long will I be in repayment under each plan? 
Income - driven repayment plans have different repayment periods. Under all four plans , any remaining loan balance is forgiven if your federal student loans aren't fully repaid at the end of the repayment period. For any income - driven repayment plan , periods of economic hardship deferment , periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans , and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period. Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt. Because of these factors , you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period. Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance. If you re making payments under an income - driven repayment plan and also working toward loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Program , you may qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you've made 10 years of qualifying payments, instead of 20 or 25 years. Qualifying payments for the PSLF Program include payments made under any of the income - driven repayment plans. 
Am I eligible for income-driven repayment? 
Defaulted loans are not eligible for repayment under any of the income - driven repayment plans. Find out how to get out of default. 
REPAYE Plan 
Any borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. 
PAYE and IBR Plans 
Each of these plans has an eligibility requirement you must meet to qualify for the plan. To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period. If the amount you would have to pay under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size is more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , you wouldn't benefit from having your monthly payment amount based on your income , so you don't qualify. Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. 
ICR Plan 
Any borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. This plan is the only available income - driven repayment option for parent PLUS loan borrowers. Although PLUS loans made to parents can t be repaid under any of the income - driven repayment plans including the ICR Plan , parent borrowers may consolidate their Direct PLUS Loans or Federal PLUS Loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and then repay the new consolidation loan under the ICR Plan though not under any other income - driven plan. 
Will I always pay the same amount each month under an income-driven repayment plan? 
No. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , your required monthly payment amount may increase or decrease if your income or family size changes from year to year. Each year you must recertify your income and family size. This means that you must provide your loan servicer with updated income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment. You must do this even if there has been no change in your income or family size. Your loan servicer will send you a reminder notice when it s time for you to recertify. To recertify , you must submit another income - driven repayment plan application. On the application , you ll be asked to select the reason you re submitting the application. Respond that you are submitting documentation of your income for the annual recertification of your payment amount. Although you re required to recertify your income and family size only once each year, if your income or family size changes significantly before your annual certification date for example, due to loss of employment , you can submit updated information and ask your servicer to recalculate your payment amount at any time. To do this , submit a new application for an income - driven repayment plan. When asked to select the reason for submitting the application , respond that you are submitting documentation early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You re not required to report changes in your financial circumstances before the annual date when you must provide updated income information. You can choose to wait until your loan servicer tells you that you need to provide updated income information at the normally scheduled time. If you choose to wait , your current required monthly payment amount will remain the same until you provide the updated income information. 
PAYE and IBR Plans 
Under these plans , your monthly payment amount will be based on your income and family size when you first begin making payments, and at any time when your income is low enough that your calculated monthly payment amount would be less than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. If your income ever increases to the point that your calculated monthly payment amount would be more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, you ll remain on the PAYE or IBR plan , but your payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment will be the amount you would pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, based on the loan amount you owed when you first began repayment under the PAYE or IBR plan. Even if your income continues to increase , your monthly payment will never be more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount. During any period when your monthly payment is not based on your income , you still have the option of recertifying your income and family size. If you recertify and your income or family size changes so that your calculated monthly payment would once again be less than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount , your servicer will recalculate your payment and you ll return to making payments that are based on your income. 
REPAYE and ICR Plans 
Under the REPAYE and ICR Plans , your payment is always based on your income and family size, regardless of any changes in your income. This means that if your income increases over time, in some cases your payment may be higher than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. 
What will happen if I don t recertify my income and family size by the annual deadline? 
It s important for you to recertify your income and family size by the specified annual deadline. If you don t recertify your income by the deadline , the consequences vary depending on the plan. Under the REPAYE Plan , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll be removed from the REPAYE Plan and placed on an alternative repayment plan. Under this alternative repayment plan , your required monthly payment is not based on your income. Instead , your payment will be the amount necessary to repay your loan in full by the earlier of a 10 years from the date you begin repaying under the alternative repayment plan, or b the ending date of your 20- or 25-year REPAYE Plan repayment period. You may choose to leave the alternative repayment plan and repay under any other repayment plan for which you are eligible. Under the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll remain on the same income - driven repayment plan , but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment amount will be the amount you would pay under a Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period, based on the loan amount you owed when you initially entered the income - driven repayment plan. You can return to making payments based on income if you provide your servicer with updated income information, and if your updated income still qualifies you to make payments based on income. In addition to the consequences described above , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline under the REPAYE, PAYE, and IBR plans , any unpaid interest will be capitalized added to the principal balance of your loans. This will increase the total cost of your loans over time, because you will then pay interest on the increased loan principal balance. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , if you don t recertify your family size each year , you ll remain on the same repayment plan , but your servicer will assume that you have a family size of one. If your actual family size is larger, but your servicer assumes a family size of one because you didn t recertify your family size , this could result in an increased monthly payment amount or for the PAYE and IBR plans loss of eligibility to make payments based on income. 
What types of federal student loans can I repay under an income-driven repayment plan? 
The chart below shows the types of federal student loans that you can repay under each of the income - driven repayment plans. * If a loan type is listed as eligible if consolidated , this means that if you consolidate that loan type into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you can then repay the consolidation loan under the income - driven plan. For example , only Direct Loans can be repaid under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. However , if you consolidate a FFEL Program Loan or Federal Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you may then be able to repay the Direct Consolidation Loan under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR Plan depending on the type of loan that you consolidate. Note that consolidation is not the right choice for all borrowers or all loan types. In particular , you may lose certain loan benefits if you consolidate a Federal Perkins Loan. Find out more about loan consolidation. Only federal student loans can be repaid under the income - driven plans. Private student loans are not eligible. 
Is an income-driven repayment plan right for me? 
Income - driven repayment plans usually lower your federal student loan payments. However , whenever you make lower payments or extend your repayment period , you will likely pay more in interest over time sometimes significantly more. In addition , under current Internal Revenue Service rules , you may be required to pay income tax on any amount that's forgiven if you still have a remaining balance at the end of your repayment period. 
How do I decide which income-driven repayment plan to choose? 
If you ve decided that an income - driven repayment plan is right for you , you ll want to choose the plan that provides the most benefit to you based on your individual circumstances. Although all four income - driven plans allow you to make a monthly payment based on your income , the plans differ in terms of who qualifies, how much you have to pay each month, the length of the repayment period, and the types of loans that can be repaid under the plan. If you have only Direct Loans , you can choose from all four income - driven repayment plans. If you re not sure which plan to choose , you have the option of requesting the income - driven plan that provides the lowest payment amount. Your servicer will determine which plans you qualify for and will then place you on the plan with the lowest monthly payment. If you have FFEL Program loans , your only income - driven repayment plan option is the IBR Plan. However , if you consolidate your FFEL Program loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you ll then have access to the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. Find out more about loan consolidation. 
How do I apply for an income-driven repayment plan? 
Before you apply for an income - driven repayment plan , contact your loan servicer if you have any questions. Your loan servicer will help you decide whether one of these plans is right for you. To apply , you must submit an application called the Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request. You can submit the application online or on a paper form, which you can get from your loan servicer. The application allows you to select an income - driven repayment plan by name, or to request that your loan servicer determine what income - driven plan or plans you qualify for, and to place you on the income - driven plan with the lowest monthly payment amount. Note: If you have more than one servicer for the loans that you want to repay under an income - driven plan , you must submit a separate request to each servicer. When you apply , you ll be asked to provide income information that will be used to determine your eligibility for the PAYE or IBR plans and to calculate your monthly payment amount under all income - driven repayment plans. This may be either your adjusted gross income AGI or alternative documentation of income. Your AGI will be used if you filed a federal income tax return in the past two years , and your current income isn t significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return. You can provide your AGI in one of the following ways : Apply using the online Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the application to transfer income information from your federal income tax return. Use the paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and provide a paper copy of your most recently filed federal income tax return or IRS tax return transcript. If you haven t filed a federal income tax return in the past two years, or if your current income is significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return for example, if you lost your job or have experienced a drop in income , alternative documentation of your income will be used to determine your eligibility and calculate your monthly payment amount. You can provide alternative documentation in one of the following ways : If you currently receive taxable income , you must submit a paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request with alternative documentation of your income, such as a pay stub. If you currently don t have any income or if you receive only untaxed income , you can indicate that on the online or paper application. In this case , you re not required to supply further documentation of your income. Depending on whether you applied electronically or submitted a paper request form and whether you ve submitted all required documents , it may take your servicer a few weeks to process your request, because they will need to obtain documentation of your income and family size. If you are currently repaying your loans under a different repayment plan , your loan servicer may apply a forbearance to your student loan account while processing your request for an income - driven repayment plan. 
What other options do I have if I need help repaying my student loans? 
If an income - driven repayment plan isn t right for you , contact your loan servicer to discuss other repayment options. You may be able to extend your repayment period through the Extended Repayment Plan or through loan consolidation. You may also be able to temporarily suspend repayment through a deferment or forbearance.

title : Aid for International Study | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Many students get federal student aid to help pay for their study at international schools, either at the undergraduate or graduate level. 
Whether you plan to study abroad for a semester or get your entire degree outside the United States , you may be able to use federal student aid to pay your expenses. The type of aid you can get and the process you must follow will depend on the type of program study - abroad or full degree you plan to enter. Your status as an undergraduate or graduate student also affects the type of aid for which you re eligible , just as it does at schools in the U.S. 
Study Abroad for a Semester or Year 
You may receive federal student aid for a study - abroad program, if you meet the aid eligibility criteria. If you aren t already in the habit of filling out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form each year for college , be sure to learn about the federal student aid programs and the FAFSA process. You ll need to fill out a FAFSA form before you can receive federal student aid to study abroad. To determine which types of aid you ll be able to use for your study - abroad program , contact the financial aid office at your American school. If your American school doesn t participate in the federal student aid programs, then you won t be able to get federal student aid to help pay for your study abroad. Start early, because it s important to get all necessary paperwork done on time, both at your American school and at the international school. The rest of the information on this page below this section does not apply to you if what you re interested in is doing a study - abroad program. 
Get a Degree From an International School 
If you ve decided to get your degree from a school outside the U.S. , congratulations. Now let us help you find out which international schools participate in the federal student aid programs and guide you through the process of getting federal aid to make a dent in that tuition bill. 
How can I research schools and their requirements? 
First , don t panic. You re on your own , but if you re organized and determined, you ll be okay. In this section , we ll share some tips about preparing to study at an international school and some resources to help you learn about schools that participate in the American federal student aid programs. Here are general tips : Start early. You ve got more to do than your friends who are going to American schools, so don t think you can apply for financial aid this month and use it to pay your tuition next month. If you re interested in a particular school, check its website to find out about program availability (does it offer the degree you want? ), cost, enrollment policies, and resources and programs for international students. Do your research and keep a to - do list. For instance , what paperwork needs to be done? (Visas? Housing forms? Registering with the police? Valid passport? Emergency contacts? Medical insurance?) Create a file to organize your documents and information from your school. Find out who at the school will be processing your financial aid. Get their email address, and contact them when you have questions. If you re not sure where to start, try the school s office for international students. Don t forget that you can get help filling out the FAFSA form either within the form itself at fafsa.gov or by phone at 1 - 800 - 4-FED - AID 1 - 800 - 433 - 3243; TTY for the deaf or hard of hearing 1 - 800 - 730 - 8913. Here are resources you can use as you decide which school to attend : International Schools in General International Schools That Participate in the Federal Student Loan Programs this list is updated quarterly, so check with your intended school to be sure it currently participates International Medical Schools for each school, find pass rates on the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, student loan debt for American medical students, and completion rates for American medical students, among other information Note : International medical schools must annually report and meet certain eligibility requirements to remain as participants in the federal student loan programs.

What federal student aid can I receive for my degree at an international school? 
At many schools around the world , you can receive a federal student loan from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program. Find out which international schools participate in the Direct Loan Program. You may receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan for your undergraduate education. Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate students. Your parent also might be able to borrow on your behalf ; he or she should ask about getting a Direct PLUS Loan for parents. International schools do not participate in the U.S. Department of Education s grant programs , so you will not be able to obtain a Federal Pell Grant to get your degree at an international school. 
How much can I receive in federal student loan funds? 
The annual limit for Direct Subsidized Loans plus Direct Unsubsidized Loans varies from $5,500 to $20,500 , depending on a variety of factors year in school, status as a dependent or independent student, etc . . Direct PLUS Loan amounts are determined by subtracting any other financial aid you re receiving from your total cost of attendance at the school. 
How do I apply for a federal student loan to use at an international school? 
Apply for student loans at your international school using the same process you use to apply for aid in the U.S. Fill out a FAFSA form at fafsa.gov as early as possible. The FAFSA form is available on Oct. 1 for school attendance that begins any time from July 1 of the following year through June of the year beyond that. There is no special FAFSA form for students planning to attend international schools. Learn how to fill out the FAFSA form. Make sure the school you plan to attend has your FAFSA information. International schools have the ability to access your FAFSA information electronically. When you fill out the FAFSA form , list the school you plan to attend in the question about Federal School Codes. The FAFSA site has a tool to let you search for your school s Federal School Code. Once it s listed on your FAFSA form , your school will then download your data. Find out the next steps from your chosen school. Different schools proceed differently at this stage of the process. Ask your school how you will get your loan money what paperwork do you need to fill out, what are the deadlines, etc. Keep track of everything that is required of you ; make copies of paper documents or scan them and file them safely; and meet those deadlines! And if your parent plans to get a Direct PLUS Loan , he or she should keep a close eye on required documents and deadlines as well. If you are a first - year student borrowing federal funds for the first time , you will have to complete entrance counseling. This means you ll be required to read text or watch a video online, or attend an in - person presentation, in order to learn about the responsibilities of taking out a loan. Your entrance counseling might happen before you leave the U.S. or after you arrive at your school ; it depends on the school. 
How will I get paid? 
Your loan funds will be electronically transmitted from the U.S. Treasury to the international school s designated bank. First the school will put the funds toward anything you owe them tuition, fees, etc . . If there is any money left over after the funds are applied to your account at the school , the extra money will go to you. Your funds might not be disbursed paid out before you leave the U.S. , so you will most likely have to come up with your travel expenses yourself. 
When and how do I repay the loan? 
That depends on whether it s a subsidized or unsubsidized loan versus a PLUS loan. Repayment of a loan used to pay for international study works the same way as repayment of a loan used to pay for an American school. Get information about repaying federal student loans. 

title : Grants | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Federal grants are money to help pay for college or career school. 
Learn about the grant programs that are available from the U.S. Department of Education. The federal government provides grants for students attending college or career school. Most types of grants , unlike loans , are sources of free money that generally do not have to be repaid. Grants can come from the federal government, your state government, your college or career school, or a private or nonprofit organization. Do your research, apply for any grants you might be eligible for, and be sure to meet application deadlines! Certain scenarios may require that a portion or all of the grant funds be repaid: for example, if you withdraw from school before finishing an enrollment period such as a semester, or if you receive a TEACH Grant and do not complete your service obligation. 
Types of Grants 
The U.S. Department of Education ED offers a variety of federal grants to students attending four - year colleges or universities, community colleges, and career schools. Check out the grant programs for more details and to learn how to apply : Federal Pell Grants Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants FSEOG Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education TEACH Grants Try This Resource Federal Student Grant Programs Lists details and award limits for different federal student grant programs. 
Grant Eligibility 
Most of our grants listed above are awarded only to students with financial need. If you are interested in our grants , or in any federal student aid , start by submitting a Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. To continue receiving federal student aid , fill out the FAFSA form every year you re in school. Visit the individual pages for each of the grants listed above to learn about additional eligibility and application requirements. Once you ve submitted a FAFSA form , your college or career school will let you know how much you may receive and when you may receive it. 
Maintaining Eligibility for Grants 
The requirements for remaining eligible to receive a grant vary from program to program. Please visit the individual page relevant to your specific grant to ensure that you meet the requirements for maintaining eligibility for that program. 
When You May Have to Repay a Grant 
Here are some examples of why you might have to repay all or part of a federal grant : You withdrew early from the program for which the grant was given to you. Your enrollment status changed in a way that reduced your eligibility for your grant for instance, if you switch from full - time enrollment to part - time, your grant amount will be reduced. You received outside scholarships or grants that reduced your need for federal student aid. You received a TEACH Grant , but you did not meet the requirements of your TEACH Grant service obligation. 
Grant Repayment 
Your school will notify you if you must repay part of your grant. From that point , you will have 45 days to either pay that portion of the grant back in full or enter into a satisfactory repayment arrangement. If you enter into a satisfactory repayment arrangement , the school may assign the debt to ED for collection or may keep the debt and allow you to make payments directly to the school. If you do not carry out one of the options described above , you will lose your eligibility for further federal student aid. Note: If you do not fulfill your service obligation for a TEACH Grant , your TEACH Grant servicer will notify you if your grants are converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans. You must then repay the loans to ED, with interest charged from the date the TEACH Grant was disbursed. 

title : Teacher Loan Forgiveness | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Wondering whether you can get your federal student loans forgiven for your service as a teacher? 
Learn about the forgiveness program to see whether you qualify. Under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program , if you teach full - time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low - income school or educational service agency, and meet other qualifications , you may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on your Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and your Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans. If you have a Direct Consolidation Loan or a Federal Consolidation Loan , you may be eligible for forgiveness of the outstanding portion of the consolidation loan that repaid an eligible Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan. 
What are the eligibility requirements? 
You must not have had an outstanding balance on Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans as of Oct. 1 , 1998, or on the date that you obtained a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan after Oct. 1 , 1998. You must have been employed as a full - time, highly qualified teacher for five complete and consecutive academic years , and at least one of those years must have been after the 1997 98 academic year. You must have been employed at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves low - income students a " low - income school or educational service agency ". The loan for which you are seeking forgiveness must have been made before the end of your five academic years of qualifying teaching service. 
Teaching for Less Than a Complete Academic Year 
If you were unable to complete a full academic year of teaching , that year may still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years if you completed at least one - half of the academic year ; and your employer considers you to have fulfilled your contract requirements for the academic year for the purposes of salary increases, tenure, and retirement ; and you were unable to complete the academic year because you returned to postsecondary education, on at least a half - time basis, in an area of study directly related to the performance of the teaching service described above ; you had a condition covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 FMLA ; or you were called or ordered to active duty status for more than 30 days as a member of a reserve component of the U.S. armed forces. 
Who is considered a teacher? 
A teacher is a person who provides direct classroom teaching, or classroom - type teaching in a nonclassroom setting. Special education teachers are considered teachers. 
Am I a highly qualified teacher? 
There are basic requirements that all teachers must meet to be considered highly qualified. There are also additional requirements that you must meet depending on whether you re an elementary or secondary school teacher, and whether you re new to the teaching profession. 
Basic Requirements for All Teachers 
To be a highly qualified teacher , you must have attained at least a bachelor s degree ; received full state certification as a teacher ; and not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. You re considered to have received full state certification even if you received your certification through alternative routes to certification or by passing the state teacher licensing examination. If you re a teacher at a public charter school , you are considered to have received full state certification as a teacher if you meet the requirements set forth in the state's public charter school law. 
Additional Requirements for Elementary School Teachers Who Are New to the Profession 
To be considered highly qualified as an elementary school teacher who is new to the profession , you must also have demonstrated subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum by passing a rigorous state test. The rigorous state test may be a state - required certification or licensing test or tests in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum. 
Additional Requirements for Middle or Secondary School Teachers Who Are New to the Profession 
To be considered highly qualified as a middle or secondary school teacher who is new to the profession , you must also have demonstrated a high level of competency in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. To demonstrate a high level of competency , you may either pass a rigorous state academic subject test in each of the academic subjects in which you teach or successfully complete an academic major, a graduate degree, course work equivalent to an undergraduate academic major, or an advanced certification or credential in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. The rigorous state test may be a state - required certification or licensing test or tests in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. 
Additional Requirements for Elementary, Middle, or Secondary School Teachers Who Are Not New to the Profession 
To be highly qualified as an elementary, middle, or secondary school teacher who is not new to the profession , you must also meet the applicable requirements for an elementary, middle, or secondary school teacher who is new to the profession or demonstrate competence in all the academic subjects in which you teach based on a high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation. The uniform state standard of evaluation may involve multiple, objective measures of teacher competency and must be set by the state for both grade - appropriate academic subject matter knowledge and teaching skills ; be aligned with challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards and developed in consultation with core content specialists, teachers, principals, and school administrators ; provide objective, coherent information about your attainment of core content knowledge in the academic subjects in which you teach ; be applied uniformly to all teachers in the same academic subject and the same grade level throughout the state ; take into consideration, but not be based primarily on, the time you have been teaching in the academic subject ; and be made available to the public upon request. 
How do I know if I m teaching at a low-income school or educational service agency? 
The school or educational service agency must be listed in the Teacher Cancellation Low Income TCLI Directory, which is published by the U.S. Department of Education ED each year. To find out if your school or educational service agency is classified as low - income , search the directory database for the years you have been employed as a teacher. If the TCLI Directory is not available before May 1 of any year , the previous year s directory may be used for that year. Any questions about the inclusion or omission of a particular school must be directed to the state education agency contact in the state where the school is located and not to ED. State education agencies are responsible for determining which schools or educational service agencies are eligible to be reported to ED for inclusion in the TCLI Directory. If your school or educational service agency is included in the TCLI Directory for at least one year of your teaching service, but is not included during subsequent years , your subsequent years of teaching at the school or educational service agency will still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years of teaching. For example , if you taught at the same school for five complete and consecutive academic years from 2011 12 through 2015 16, but the school was included in the TCLI Directory only for the 2011 12 academic year , your subsequent four academic years of teaching at that school can still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years. Teaching service performed at an educational service agency may be counted toward the required five years of teaching only if the consecutive five - year period includes qualifying service at an eligible educational service agency performed after the 2007 08 academic year. All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education BIE or operated on Indian reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with BIE qualify as schools serving low - income students. These schools are qualifying schools for the purposes of this loan forgiveness program, even if they are not listed in the TCLI Directory. 
How much loan forgiveness can I receive? 
The maximum forgiveness amount is either $17,500 or $5,000, depending on the subject area taught. If you have eligible loans under both the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program , $ 17,500 or $5,000 is a combined maximum forgiveness amount for both programs. You may receive up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness if you were a highly qualified full - time mathematics or science teacher who taught students at the secondary school level ; or a highly qualified special education teacher at either the elementary or secondary level whose primary responsibility was to provide special education to children with disabilities , and you taught children with disabilities that corresponded to your area of special education training and demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in the content areas of the curriculum that you taught. If you didn't teach mathematics, science, or special education , you may receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness if you were a highly qualified full - time elementary or secondary education teacher. 
Can I receive loan forgiveness under both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program? 
You can potentially receive forgiveness under both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, but not for the same period of teaching service. For example , if you complete five consecutive years of qualifying teaching and receive forgiveness of your Direct Loans under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program , any payments you made on your Direct Loans during that five - year period cannot be counted toward the required 120 monthly payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. To receive Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you would need to make 120 more qualifying monthly payments. 
Teacher Loan Forgiveness and AmeriCorps Program Benefits 
If you re an AmeriCorps Program volunteer , a period of teaching that qualifies you for a benefit through the AmeriCorps Program cannot be counted toward the required five consecutive years of teaching for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. 
Can I receive teacher loan forgiveness on my PLUS loans or Federal Perkins Loans? 
PLUS loans for parents and graduate or professional students aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. Federal Perkins Loans aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. However , you may be eligible to have all or a portion of your Federal Perkins Loan canceled based on your employment or volunteer service or discharged under certain conditions. 
Am I eligible for teacher loan forgiveness if I m in default on a loan? 
If you re in default on a loan , you are not eligible for forgiveness of that loan unless you have made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the holder of the defaulted loan. 
How and when do I apply for teacher loan forgiveness? 
You apply for teacher loan forgiveness by submitting a completed Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application to your loan servicer after you have completed the required five consecutive years of qualifying teaching. The chief administrative officer of the school or educational service agency where you performed your qualifying teaching service must complete the certification section. If you are applying for forgiveness of loans that are with different loan servicers , you must submit a separate form to each of them.

title : Student Loan Consolidation | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Consolidating your federal education loans can simplify your payments, but it also can result in the loss of some benefits. 
Learn about consolidation so you can weigh the pros and cons and decide whether a Direct Consolidation Loan is right for you. A Direct Consolidation Loan allows you to consolidate combine multiple federal education loans into one loan. The result is a single monthly payment instead of multiple payments. Loan consolidation can also give you access to additional loan repayment plans and forgiveness programs. There is no application fee to consolidate your federal education loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan. You may be contacted by private companies that offer to help you apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan, for a fee. These companies have no affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education ED or ED s consolidation loan servicers. There s no need to pay anyone for assistance in getting a Direct Consolidation Loan. The application process is easy and free. 
Should I consolidate my loans? 
The answer depends on your individual circumstances. Pros If you currently have federal student loans that are with different loan servicers , consolidation can greatly simplify loan repayment by giving you a single loan with just one monthly bill. Consolidation can lower your monthly payment by giving you a longer period of time up to 30 years to repay your loans. If you consolidate loans other than Direct Loans , consolidation may give you access to additional income - driven repayment plan options and Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF. Direct Loans are from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. You ll be able to switch any variable - rate loans you have to a fixed interest rate. Cons Because consolidation usually increases the period of time you have to repay your loans , you will likely make more payments and pay more in interest than would be the case if you didn t consolidate. When you consolidate your loans , any outstanding interest on the loans that you consolidate becomes part of the original principal balance on your consolidation loan, which means that interest may accrue on a higher principal balance than might have been the case if you had not consolidated. Consolidation may also cause you to lose certain borrower benefits such as interest rate discounts, principal rebates, or some loan cancellation benefits that are associated with your current loans. If you re paying your current loans under an income - driven repayment plan , or if you ve made qualifying payments toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness , consolidating your current loans will cause you to lose credit for any payments made toward income - driven repayment plan forgiveness or PSLF. If consolidation would cause you to lose the benefits associated with some of your current loans and you are working toward earning those benefits , you should not include those loans in your new Direct Consolidation Loan. When you apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan , you don t have to consolidate all of your eligible loans. For example , if you have both Direct Loans and other types of federal student loans, and you have been making payments toward PSLF on your Direct Loans , you should not consolidate your Direct Loans along with your other loans. Similarly , if you have Federal Perkins Loans and you are employed in an occupation that would qualify you for Perkins Loan cancellation benefits , you should not include your Perkins Loans when you consolidate. Leaving out your Direct Loans or Perkins Loans will preserve the benefits on those loans. If you want to lower your monthly payment amount but are concerned about the impact of loan consolidation , you might want to consider deferment or forbearance as options for short - term payment relief, or consider switching to an income - driven repayment plan for longer - term payment relief. Once your loans are combined into a Direct Consolidation Loan , they cannot be removed. The loans that were consolidated are paid off and no longer exist. 
What types of loans can be consolidated? 
Most federal student loans, including the following, are eligible for consolidation : Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans Unsubsidized and Nonsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans PLUS loans from the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program Supplemental Loans for Students Federal Perkins Loans Nursing Student Loans Nurse Faculty Loans Health Education Assistance Loans Health Professions Student Loans Loans for Disadvantaged Students Direct Subsidized Loans Direct Unsubsidized Loans Direct PLUS Loans FFEL Consolidation Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans only under certain conditions Federal Insured Student Loans Guaranteed Student Loans National Direct Student Loans National Defense Student Loans Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students Auxiliary Loans to Assist Students Private education loans are not eligible for consolidation , but for some Direct Consolidation Loan repayment plans, the total amount of your education loan debt including any private education loans determines how long you have to repay your Direct Consolidation Loan. Direct PLUS Loans received by parents to help pay for a dependent student s education cannot be consolidated together with federal student loans that the student received. 
When can I consolidate my loans? 
Generally , you are eligible to consolidate after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half - time enrollment. 
What are the requirements to consolidate a loan? 
Here are some of the eligibility requirements for receiving a Direct Consolidation Loan : The loans you consolidate must be in repayment or in the grace period. Generally , you cannot consolidate an existing consolidation loan unless you include an additional eligible loan in the consolidation. Under certain circumstances , you may reconsolidate an existing FFEL Consolidation Loan without including any additional loans. If you want to consolidate a defaulted loan , you must either make satisfactory repayment arrangements defined as three consecutive monthly payments on the loan before you consolidate, or you must agree to repay your new Direct Consolidation Loan under the Income-Based Repayment Plan, Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan , Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan , or Income-Contingent Repayment Plan. If you want to consolidate a defaulted loan that is being collected through garnishment of your wages, or that is being collected in accordance with a court order after a judgment was obtained against you , you cannot consolidate the loan unless the wage garnishment order has been lifted or the judgment has been vacated. * You may be able to reconsolidate an existing delinquent or defaulted FFEL Consolidation Loan and repay your new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven repayment plan ; FFEL Consolidation Loan in order to qualify for the PSLF Program ; or FFEL Consolidation Loan to use the no accrual of interest benefit for active duty service members, which states that you re not required to pay the interest that accrues during periods of qualifying active duty military service for up to 60 months on the portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Loan Program or FFEL Program loan first disbursed on or after Oct. 1 , 2008. 
What is the interest rate on a consolidation loan? 
A Direct Consolidation Loan has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. The fixed rate is the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one - eighth of one percent. There is no cap on the interest rate of a Direct Consolidation Loan. 
When do I begin repayment? 
Repayment of a Direct Consolidation Loan will begin within 60 days after the loan is disbursed paid out. Your loan servicer will let you know when the first payment is due. If any of the loans you want to consolidate are still in the grace period , you have the option of indicating on your Direct Consolidation Loan application that you want the servicer that is processing your application to delay the consolidation of your loans until closer to the grace period end date. If you select this option , you won t have to begin making payments on your new Direct Consolidation Loan until closer to the end of the grace period on your current loans. 
Are there different repayment plans? 
Borrowers have different needs , so there are several repayment plans including income - driven repayment plans, which base your monthly payment amount on your income and family size. You ll select a repayment plan when you apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan. Learn about repayment plans.

I received a TPD discharge but want to go back to school. Can I take out more student loans or TEACH Grants? 
Yes , but with some conditions. If you received a TPD discharge based on VA documentation, SSA documentation, or a physician s certification , you must give your school a letter from a physician stating that you are once again able to engage in substantial gainful activity , and sign a statement acknowledging that you can't get a TPD discharge of the new loan or TEACH Grant based on a disabling condition that already exists when you receive the new loan or TEACH Grant, unless that condition substantially deteriorates in the future.

If my loan is discharged due to TPD, do I have to pay taxes on the discharged loan amount? 
Because of a change in federal law related to the taxability of loan amounts discharged due to TPD , the answer depends on when you received the discharge. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan before Jan. 1 , 2018 , the loan amount discharged may be considered income for federal tax purposes under Internal Revenue Service IRS rules. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan during the period from Jan. 1 , 2018 to Dec. 31 , 2025 , the discharged loan amount won t be considered income for federal tax purposes. For purposes of determining whether a loan amount discharged due to TPD may be treated as taxable income for federal tax purposes , the date you are considered to have received the discharge is different depending on how you qualified for the discharge. If you re a veteran who showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on a disability determination by the VA , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes on the date we approve the discharge. If you showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on documentation from the SSA or a physician s certification meaning that you re subject to a three - year postdischarge monitoring period , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes at the end of the postdischarge monitoring period. For example , if your discharge was approved in July 2017 , you would not be considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes until July 2020, at the end of the three - year postdischarge monitoring period. Therefore , the IRS would not consider the discharged loan amount to be taxable income for federal tax purposes. If you receive a Form 1099-C, you should keep the form for your records , but you do not need to include it when filing your federal tax return. For additional information , visit irs.gov. Loan amounts discharged due to TPD may still be considered income for state tax purposes. If you receive a TPD discharge of a federal student loan , you may want to consult with your state tax office or a tax professional before you file your state tax return.

Who Qualifies for Borrower Defense to Repayment Loan Forgiveness 
Under the law , you may be eligible for borrower defense to repayment forgiveness of the federal student loans that you took out to attend a school if that school misled you, or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws. Specifically , you may assert borrower defense by demonstrating that the school, through an act or omission, violated state law directly related to your federal student loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. You may be eligible for borrower defense regardless of whether your school closed or you are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under other laws. If you are eligible to receive federal student loan forgiveness , you may be able to have all or part of your outstanding federal student loan debt forgiven , and you also may be reimbursed for amounts you have already paid on those loans. You will only be eligible for this type of federal student loan forgiveness if your school s misleading activities or other misconduct directly relate to the loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. You will not be eligible for this type of forgiveness based on claims that are not directly related to your loan or the educational services provided by the school. For example , personal injury claims or claims based on allegations of harassment are not bases for a borrower defense application. Please note that eligibility for federal student loan forgiveness is limited to federal student loans taken out for payment to the school relating to your borrower defense application. If you would like to apply for borrower defense against multiple schools that you attended and for which you took out federal student loans , you must submit separate applications for each school of attendance. For the purposes of borrower defense discharge only , we interpret the term Direct Loan in 34 CFR 685.206 to include Direct Consolidation loans. This interpretation enables borrowers with loans eligible for Direct Loan consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans or Federal Perkins Loans, to avail themselves of the borrower discharge process provided here by consolidating such loans into the Direct Loan Program. 
Forbearance/Stopped Collections Status 
Within the application , you may select to have your federal student loans placed into forbearance or stopped collections status while your application is reviewed by ED. If you choose for your loans to be placed into forbearance or stopped collections status, shortly after we receive your application , your loans will be placed in forbearance , and collections will cease on any of your loans that are in default while your application is evaluated. NOTE: If you do not select one of the forbearance or stopped collection options within the application, your federal student loans will be placed into forbearance or stopped collection , and ED will request forbearance or stopped collection for any commercially held Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans that you have currently. Interest will continue to accrue for the loans in forbearance while your application is evaluated. More information on forbearance and stopped collections is available immediately below in the Common Questions and Answers Regarding Forbearance / Stopped Collections section. Automatic Administrative Forbearance and Temporary 0% Interest as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. In addition , interest is being temporarily set at 0% on federal student loans. This 0% interest and suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out what loans qualify, and get additional information about the 0% interest period, administrative forbearance, and other student loan flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency. 
Common Questions and Answers Regarding Forbearance/Stopped Collections Status 
By completing and submitting a borrower defense application , you may have all of your federal student loans in repayment placed into forbearance status and have debt collections on any federal student loans in default stopped stopped collections status while ED reviews your application. However , please note interest will continue to accumulate on federal student loans regardless of what status they are in, including for subsidized loans. If your application for borrower defense is denied or partially approved , then when you are taken out of forbearance or stopped collections , the interest that accumulated will be added to the amount you owed when you entered forbearance or stopped collections , and the total amount you owe in the future may be higher. NOTE : You do not have to place your loans in forbearance or stopped collections to apply for borrower defense forgiveness. If you do not select one of the forbearance or stopped collection options within the application , your ED - held Federal Student Aid loans will automatically be placed into forbearance and stopped collections , and ED will request forbearance and debt collection to stop for any commercially held FFEL Program loans that you have currently as applicable. Please read the following question and answer Q & A section carefully before you choose whether you want the U.S. Department of Education to place your loans into forbearance or stopped collections. What does forbearance status mean? During any period that your federal student loans are in forbearance , you do not have to make payments on those loans , and the loans will not go into default. This will continue until the borrower defense review process of your application is completed. Your loan servicer will notify you when your federal student loan have been placed into forbearance status. Until you receive that notice , you must continue to make payments. What does stopped collections status mean? During any period that your loans are in default , if you choose to enter stopped collections status , collections on your loans will stop. For federal student loans that are placed into stopped collections status , the federal government or debt collection companies will stop attempting to collect on the loan, including by not withholding money from your wages or income tax refunds. This will continue until the borrower defense review process of your application is completed. If you previously defaulted on your federal student loan and have entered a rehabilitation plan , please contact the collection agency that you have been working with to set up that plan in order to determine whether there may be any negative consequences if you choose to enter stopped collections status. Which of my federal student loans are eligible to go into forbearance or stopped collections status? Initially , if you choose forbearance or stopped collections status , it will affect all of your federal student loans that are owned by ED and are being serviced by your federal student loan servicer, including loans that are not eligible for borrower defense loan forgiveness, such as 1 loans taken out to attend another institution, and 2 any loans you have for which you are not asserting borrower defense. If you select forbearance and you have commercially held FFEL Program loans , ED will request forbearance on your behalf. Can I remove some or all of my federal student loans from forbearance or stopped collections status? If you want the forbearance or stopped collections status to apply only to those federal student loans related to your borrower defense application , you must contact your loan servicer after you hear from your loan servicer and your servicer confirms the forbearance or stopped collection status. After your loans enter forbearance or stopped collection status , if at any time you want to remove all of your federal student loans from forbearance or stopped collections , you must also contact your loan servicer. Can I make payments on my federal student loans that are in forbearance or stopped collections? Yes. While your federal student loans are in forbearance or stopped collections , you are not required to pay your loans. However , you are allowed to make payments on any of your loans that are in forbearance or stopped collections, including payments for accrued interest. As noted above , interest will continue to accrue on all of these loans while they are in forbearance or stopped collections. What happens if my borrower defense application against the school is successful? Your federal student loans related to your application may be discharged partially or completely. If you receive a partial discharge , you will be responsible for repaying any amounts that are not discharged through borrower defense including any interest that accumulated. Also , at that time , the forbearance or stopped collections period for any of your other federal student loans will end. You will be responsible for repaying those other loans, if applicable, including interest that accrued during the forbearance or stopped collections period. What happens if my borrower defense application against the school is denied? You will not receive a discharge of any of your federal student loans and the forbearance or stopped collections period will end for all of your loans. You will be responsible for repaying these loans, including interest that accrued during the forbearance or stopped collections period. Q.

Common Questions and Answers Regarding Borrower Defense Decision Notifications 
The U.S. Department of Education ED notifies borrower defense applicants of ED s determination about borrower defense discharge eligibility. The notifications are emailed to borrowers. If you have questions about your notification email that aren t answered below , call our borrower defense hotline : 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207. Representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time ET. Q. I received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is approved. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application for a borrower defense discharge of your Direct Loans under the applicable borrower defense to repayment rules and determined that your claim associated with your enrollment or your child s enrollment at the school identified in that notification email is approved. Your borrower defense application was evaluated based on the applicable state law and the circumstances identified in your notification email. Your notification email identified the percentage of the total amount of the Direct Loans you took out to pay for your program that will be discharged. You should receive notification of your discharge from your federal loan servicer within 90 120 days after you received your notification email. As explained in the What happens next? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification of your discharge from your federal loan servicer. Does the borrower defense discharge apply to all loans I took out to pay for my program? No. This borrower defense discharge applies only to your Direct Loans. This borrower defense discharge does not apply to private student loans or other loans you may have received from programs administered by federal or state agencies, including other programs administered by ED. ED will proceed with the applicable discharge of your Direct Loans. If some of your federal student loans are Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans and/or Federal Perkins Loan Program loans , they are not eligible for discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment law or regulations. If you want to have your borrower defense discharge apply to your FFEL and/or Federal Perkins loans , you can consolidate your loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and obtain the discharge. To apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan , go to StudentAid.gov/app/launchConsolidation.action. Once you have your Direct Consolidation Loan , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday to proceed with discharge. How did ED determine my discharge percentage? For approved borrower discharge claims , ED calculated the amount of borrower defense discharge relief by comparing the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at a borrower s school median program earnings to the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at other schools median comparison earnings. Specifically , ED used a statistical tool called standard deviation to identify the range of program earnings that would qualify for loan relief, and then divided that range into quartiles to determine the amount of relief a borrower would be provided. If your program earnings exceeded the comparison earnings , then , even if you filed an approved claim , you will not receive a discharge unless your approved application is associated with Corinthian Colleges, Inc. CCI. If your approved application is associated with CCI , you will receive at least a 10% discharge. The larger the negative gap between your program earnings and comparison earnings , the greater the amount of loan discharge you received. The Borrower Defense Partial Relief Methodology tables used by ED to determine relief percentages are provided for your reference. When viewing the earnings charts , note the following : No Data Available appears when there was no data available to complete a calculation. The wording under Program Name may not match exactly to the program name used by your school. There can be slight wording differences in the program name used by the school and the program name shown in the earnings chart. The word Diploma under the Credential column , means the same as Certificate Program, which is often used by schools. Will prior payments be refunded after my discharge is applied? A time limitation applies on receiving a refund of payments made on your federal student loans when a borrower defense claim is approved. We will inform your loan servicer whether you filed your borrower defense to repayment application within the applicable number of years of separating from leaving your school. One of two things will happen. If you filed your application within the applicable limitation period and your loan payments exceed the amount owed after your discharge is applied , you will be eligible for a refund of payments. Your loan servicer will apply the borrower defense discharge to your student loan account and then determine whether you still have an outstanding amount balance due on any Direct Loans. If a balance remains on your account after your discharge is applied , your servicer will apply any prior payments made on the discharged loans first to the remaining balance of your discharged loans and then to the balance of other Direct Loans on your account. If no balance remains on your account , your servicer will return the refund amount to you. If you filed your application outside the applicable limitation period or your loan payments are less than the amount owed after your discharge is applied , you will not be eligible for a refund of payments. Your loan servicer will not apply any prior payments made on the discharged loans or return any refund amount to you. Your loan servicer will let you know if you are eligible or ineligible for a refund of payments. Will interest be waived in addition to my discharge? For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. Your federal loan servicer will let you know what your remaining balance is after the interest waiver has been applied. Note: If you receive a 100% discharge , you do not receive a separate interest waiver because your entire loan balance, including any interest, is discharged. Q. I m a CCI borrower and received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is ineligible for relief. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application under the applicable Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations for discharge of your Direct Loans made in connection with your or your child s enrollment at a school operated by CCI, including Everest Institute, Everest College, Everest University, Heald College, and WyoTech. ED has determined that your application is ineligible for relief based on review of the facts of your claim and the regulatory criteria for relief ; this decision means that your Direct Loans will not be discharged. ED s reasons for this determination are as follows : Applicable Law For Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1 , 2017 , a borrower may be eligible for a discharge forgiveness of part or all of one or more Direct Loans if the borrower s school engaged in acts or omissions that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable state law. See 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended , 20 U.S.C. 1087e , and 34 CFR 685.206 and 685.222 the Borrower Defense regulations. ED recognizes a borrower s defense to repayment of a Direct Loan only if the cause of action directly relates to the Direct Loan or to the school s provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was provided. 34 CFR 685.206 , 685.222 ; U.S. Department of Education, Notice of Interpretation , 60 Fed. Reg. 37,769 July 21 , 1995. Borrower Defense Claims Based on CCI Job Placement Rates ED has determined that students who first enrolled in certain programs at certain schools operated by CCI between 2010 and 2014 have borrower defense claims arising from the publication of misleading job placement rates for many of their programs of study and are eligible for a discharge of part or all of their loans under ED s Borrower Defense regulation. Lists of covered programs and time periods are available for Everest / WyoTech and Heald the covered programs. In order to have a successful borrower defense claim based on ED s CCI findings , you must have enrolled in one of the covered programs during a listed time period. ED has established a process for the review of borrower defense to repayment claims for job placement rates asserted by borrowers enrolled in the covered programs at CCI schools during the eligibility period. Each CCI borrower s application is reviewed under the same process to determine whether the borrower qualifies for borrower defense to payment relief based on a CCI school job placement rate claim. Why was my CCI application determined to be ineligible? A. ED reviewed your application regarding the campuses you attended, the programs in which you enrolled, and the dates that you enrolled. ED also reviewed data from the National Student Loan Data System NSLDS database and, if available, school - provided data regarding your programs and enrollment dates, in addition to the enrollment information on any official school documents that you provided with your application. You includes your child if you are a Direct PLUS Loan borrower who requested a discharge for loans taken out to pay for a child s enrollment at a CCI - operated institution. Based on that review , ED has determined that you did not enroll in a covered program at a CCI school during the eligibility period. Either a the initial enrollment dates or programs you provided in your application fell outside the eligibility period for a covered program at one or more of the CCI campuses or b both NSLDS data and the school s data demonstrated that you were not enrolled in a covered program at one or more of the CCI schools during the eligibility period. Moreover , your borrower defense application did not describe any other act or omission by the CCI schools that related to the making of your Direct Loans for enrollment or the provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was made and that would be actionable under state law. Accordingly , ED has determined that your borrower defense to repayment application is ineligible and will not discharge your Direct Loans. Your borrower defense application was evaluated based on California state law and the circumstances identified in your notification email. For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. As explained in the What should I do now? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification from your federal loan servicer. If you disagree with this decision , you can ask ED to reconsider your borrower defense application. Q. I m a non - CCI borrower and received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is ineligible for relief. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application under the applicable Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations for discharge of your Direct Loans made in connection with your or your child s enrollment at the school identified in that notification email. ED has determined that your application is ineligible for relief based on review of the facts of your claim and the regulatory criteria for relief ; this decision means that your Direct Loans will not be discharged. Applicable Law For Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1 , 2017 , a borrower may be eligible for a discharge forgiveness of part or all of one or more Direct Loans if the borrower s school engaged in acts or omissions that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable state law. See 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended , 20 U.S.C. 1087e , and 34 CFR 685.206 and 685.222 the Borrower Defense regulations. ED recognizes a borrower s defense to repayment of a Direct Loan only if the cause of action directly relates to the Direct Loan or to the school s provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was provided. 34 CFR 685.206 , 685.222 ; U.S. Department of Education, Notice of Interpretation , 60 Fed. Reg. 37,769 July 21 , 1995. Why was my non - CCI application determined to be ineligible? A. ED reviewed your borrower defense claim based on any evidence submitted by you in support of your application, your loan data from the NSLDS database, as well as evidence gathered from the sources identified in your notification email. Each allegation of misconduct you claimed is identified in your email along with the reason that claim failed. For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. As explained in the What should I do now? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification from your federal loan servicer. If you disagree with the percentage discharge determined under the formula or with other parts of this decision , you can ask ED to reconsider your borrower defense application. Q. I received more than one notification email about my borrower defense claim. Should this have happened? There are two circumstances that would result in your receipt of more than one notification email. If you have two email addresses associated with your borrower defense application , ED sent a notification email to both addresses. If you have a borrower defense application that was approved and a different borrower defense application that was determined to be ineligible , ED sent you a notification email specific to each application. To check the notification emails you received , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday.

In the new application , you should explain in the relevant sections the basis for any new borrower defense claims and submit all supporting evidence.

In addition , if your borrower defense claim was approved , ED will not begin its review of your request for reconsideration until your federal loan servicer notifies you that the discharge has been completed. For more information about reconsideration , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday.

If you wish to file a new application regarding acts or omissions by your school other than those described in the borrower defense application identified in your notification email , submit an application. In the new application , you should explain in the relevant sections the basis for any new borrower defense claims and submit all supporting evidence. What should I know about repayment? A. ED offers a variety of loan repayment options, including standard, graduated, and extended repayment plans, which base your payment on your loan balance and interest rate, as well as income driven repayment plans, which base your payment on your income. Remember , that while you can choose a repayment plan that lowers your monthly payment amount, it may also increase the amount of interest you pay over time which sometimes is significantly more. For more information about student loan repayment options , visit StudentAid.gov/plans. If you don t begin or resume repayment when required , your loans may be placed into default. Defaulting on your loans subjects you to collection activity that includes administrative wage garnishment taking money out of your pay ; you may be owed offset of state and federal payments taking money owed to you by the government ; and litigation taking legal action against you.

DeVos lawsuit to borrower defense applicants who are potential members of the group of borrowers to whom the lawsuit applies to inform them that there is a proposed settlement of the lawsuit. The settlement will not become final until it is approved by the court as fair, adequate, and reasonable. The notification describes how borrowers legal rights may be affected by the settlement. ED will send borrowers two notifications one by email and one by mail. The email notifications will be sent to borrowers from the email address noreply@studentaid.gov. The mailed notifications will be sent to borrowers in an envelope marked with Federal Student Aid s return address. If you have questions about notifications you receive that aren t answered below , there s more information about the Sweet v. DeVos lawsuit on Class Counsel s website at predatorystudentlending.org/sweet-v-devos-class-members/. Q. I received an email from noreply@studentaid.gov and/or a letter saying that I may be part of a group of borrowers under a lawsuit called Sweet v. DeVos. Are these communications legitimate? Yes. The case Sweet v. DeVos , No. 19-cv-3674 (N.D. Cal. ), is a lawsuit that was filed in a federal court in California by seven borrower defense applicants who represent, with certain exceptions, all borrowers with pending borrower defense applications as of April 7, 2020. The lawsuit challenges the fact that ED did not issue a final decision on any borrower defense applications from any school between June 2018 and December 2019. The lawsuit is ONLY about the fact that final decisions were not issued during that period of time, NOT whether those applications should result in loan cancellation or not. Now , both parties are proposing to settle this lawsuit. This proposed settlement is a compromise of disputed claims , and ED continues to deny that it has acted unlawfully. Who is included in the group of people the class represented by Sweet v. DeVos? The case Sweet v. DeVos includes all people who borrowed a Direct Loan or FFEL loan to pay for a program of higher education, who have asserted a borrower defense to repayment to the U.S. Department of Education, whose borrower defense has not been granted or denied on the merits, and who is not a class member in Manriquez v. DeVos, No. 17-cv-7210 (N.D. Cal. What are the terms of the proposed settlement? In the proposed settlement , ED agrees to resolve pending borrower defense applications of people who have borrower defense applications pending as of April 7 , 2020, on the following terms : ED will approve or deny all Sweet class members pending borrower defense applications within 18 months of when the settlement agreement is approved by the court. ED will notify you of whether your claim was approved, whether you will receive any loan cancellation, and if so, how much loan cancellation you will receive. If your application is approved and you are entitled to any loan discharge , ED will complete the process of canceling some or all of your outstanding loan debt within 21 months of the date on which the settlement agreement is approved by the court. ED will provide your lawyers with information about its progress making borrower defense decisions every three months, including how many decisions ED has made, how many borrowers have received a loan discharge, and any new borrower defense findings ED has made. ED confirms, consistent with governing law and existing policies, that if you are in default, it will not take action to collect your debt, such as by garnishing your wages that is, taking part of your paycheck or taking portions of your tax refund, while your application is pending.

Notifications Regarding Manriquez v. DeVos Lawsuit 
Beginning Dec. 26 , 2019 , the U.S. Department of Education ED will email notifications about the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit to borrower defense applicants who are potential members of the group of borrowers to whom the lawsuit applies. The email notifications will be sent to borrowers from the email address noreply@studentaid.gov. For borrowers without a good email address , ED will mail notifications. The mailed notifications will be sent to borrowers in an envelope marked with Federal Student Aid s return address. Each borrower will receive either an emailed notification or a mailed notification. If you have questions about notifications you receive that aren t answered below , there s more information about the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit on Class Counsel s website at harvardlaw.github.io/ppsl_dropdown/index. You can contact the lawyers representing the covered class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit by emailing CMclass@law.harvard.edu or calling 617 - 390 - 2612. Q. I received an email from noreply@studentaid.gov saying that I may be part of a group of borrowers protected under a lawsuit called Manriquez v. DeVos. Is this email legitimate? Yes. You may be part of a group referred to as a class that is protected in certain ways because of a lawsuit called Manriquez v. DeVos. The U.S. Department of Education ED contacted you to make sure you know how to determine if you are part of the class , what protections you have , that ED made mistakes recently that may have applied to you , what ED has done to fix the mistakes , and where to find more information about the lawsuit and your federal student loans. ED contacted you because its records show that you borrowed one or more Direct Loans to attend or for your child to attend Heald College, Everest Institute, or WyoTech, operated by Corinthian Colleges, Inc. ED s records also show that you asked to cancel some or all of your federal student loan debt because the school you attended or that your child attended did something wrong. This is known as a borrower defense application. The intent of the email was to inform you generally about the lawsuit and give you contact information for obtaining additional information if needed. How do I find out if I m part of the group / class and get more information? To determine if you re a member of the class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit , visit the website set up by the class lawyers. You can contact the lawyers representing the covered class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit by emailing CMclass@law.harvard.edu or calling 617 - 390 - 2612. ED will still review and decide your borrower defense even if you are not a member of the class. What protections does the class get? A June 2018 court order in the lawsuit stops ED from collecting federal student loan payments from members of the class until the lawsuit is over. Since June 2018 , class members have not been required to make any payments on their loans related to Everest, Heald, or WyoTech. Loans that were not in default as of June 2018 should be placed into something called forbearance or another appropriate repayment status, such as an income - driven repayment plan that requires a payment of zero dollars or in - school deferment status. These statuses mean no payments are required , and your loans cannot go into default. Loans that were in default as of June 2018 should be placed in what is known as a stopped collections status. This status means ED must stop collecting money from you, such as by taking part of your paycheck or tax refund. What mistakes have been made? Many people in the class did not receive these protections. Specifically , since June 2018 , that work for ED mistakenly ED and companies sent bills to students and parents for money they were not required to pay , collected money from students and parents that they were not required to pay , reduced tax refunds or paychecks from students and parents , and made negative reports to credit reporting agencies. ED sincerely regrets these mistakes. What has ED done to fix its errors? A. ED has confirmed that potential class members are in the correct repayment status. ED is working with the Department of the Treasury to make sure that other payments that should not have been made, or that you would not have made otherwise, are given back. ED has also worked to fix any bad credit reporting that came from its mistakes. ED will work harder to make sure further mistakes do not happen. ED will review accounts of all potential people in the class to make sure there are no additional problems.

title : Understanding College Costs | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
College and career school costs can vary significantly from school to school. 
Learn about college costs and get tips on how to lower costs when you go to school. The cost of college can include a variety of items including some you might not expect. By understanding college costs , you can compare schools and explore options for how to lower your costs. 
What is included in the cost of college? 
College costs include more than tuition and room and board. Here are common costs : Make sure colleges and career schools give you a clear statement of their tuition and fees. 
How can I lower the cost of college? 
Here are some suggestions on how you might be able to lower the cost of college. For many of these suggestions , you ll want to follow up with the colleges or career schools you are interested in to get additional details. Set a budget and stick to it! Having a budget will help you compare anticipated college or career school expenses against your potential available income and financial aid. You also can use a budget to compare costs between different schools. Learn about budgeting. College or career school costs can vary significantly and there are many schools with affordable tuition and generous financial assistance. Make sure to research all schools that may meet your academic and financial needs. To find colleges or career schools , use our college search tool, College Navigator. You may be able to get school credit based on your knowledge or life experiences , and you can manage your course work to reduce costs. Ask your school whether it s possible to test out of any classes. If you don t take a class , you may not have to pay for the credits. Some colleges give credit for life experiences, thereby reducing the number of credits needed for graduation. Most schools charge a set price for a specific number of credits taken in a semester. If academically possible , take the maximum number of credits allowed. This strategy reduces the amount of time needed to graduate. Some schools offer combined degree programs or three - year programs that allow you to take all of the courses needed for graduation in three years, instead of four, thereby eliminating one year's educational expenses. Colleges and career schools may offer discounts on tuition if you are a child of an alumnus or alumna i.e., if your parent went to the school ; more than one family member is enrolled at the school ; you are a student government leader or the editor of the college newspaper or yearbook ; you are an older student ; your family s main wage earner is unemployed ; or you or a member of your family works at the school. Housing costs can add up. Here are some tips for reducing your housing costs : If you go to a college or career school near home , consider living with your parents or other family. If you live off - campus , consider sharing a house or apartment with multiple housemates to cut down the cost of rent, and carpool to save on gas and parking. Most colleges and universities sponsor resident advisor programs that offer reduced tuition or reduced room and board costs if you work in a residence hall. You may be eligible for health care benefits including the following : Most young adults can stay on their parents family plan until they turn 26, even if they are married or still living with their parents. If you have been uninsured because of a pre - existing condition , you may be eligible to join the Pre - Existing Condition Insurance Plan. If you are in a new insurance plan , insurance companies cannot charge you a deductible or copays for recommended or preventive services such as flu shots or other immunizations. You can work part - time to pay part of your costs. Be sure your work and school schedules don t conflict and that you have enough time for studying. Here are a couple of options : The Federal Work - Study Program provides an opportunity to earn money while going to school. Ask schools if they participate in the program. Cooperative education programs allow students to alternate between working full - time and studying full - time. Most schools have placement offices that help students find employment and personnel offices that hire students to work on campus. Taking small steps can add up. For example , you can lower the cost of textbooks if you buy used books or rent textbooks if you won t need the books once you finish the class. A credit card can help you build a credit history, if you use it wisely. But use it for emergencies only and don t spend more than you can afford to pay. If you decide to get a credit card , make sure you understand the terms. 
How can I compare the costs of colleges? 
You can find information about whether the cost of a college is low, medium, or high by using the College Scorecard. Keep in mind that a higher - priced school might have more financial aid available to help you pay for your education, so take a look at the school s net price if you want an idea of how much it might cost you after financial aid is taken into account.

title : Questions and Answers About FAFSA® Completion Data | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Questions and Answers About FAFSA Completion Data 
Below are questions we ve heard about the Completion by High School and Public School District">data we provide on FAFSA completion by high school. 
Basics 

Missing or Duplicate High Schools 

Low Completion Totals 

Technical and Analytical 

Basics 

What is the source of data? 
The source of the data is the U.S. Department of Education's Central Processing System. 
What years of Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) submission and completion data are available? 
Federal Student Aid releases data for the current 2018 19 cycle and provides a side - by - side comparison of the previous 2017 18 cycle. We also have an archive that contains data files from the 2017 18 cycle comparing it to the past 2016 17 cycle. Each file has the previous cycle data through the same date in the prior year as well as the 6-month and 12-month numbers for the previous cycle. Only numbers of submitted and completed FAFSA forms are available. No personally identifiable information for any FAFSA filer will be shared through this process. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you see data that is inaccurate and/or you have suggestions for improvement. We welcome your input. 
What is the difference between a submitted and a completed FAFSA form? 
Submitted applications reflect all FAFSA forms submitted by students at that high school. These applications , however , can be subsequently rejected by the Central Processing System if they are missing key pieces of information. The applications that are not rejected are referred to as completed applications. Completed applications , therefore , are a subset of all submitted applications. If a FAFSA form is submitted but not complete , the student will receive an email from the Department of Education asking him or her to correct the FAFSA form. A completed FAFSA form is necessary to determine eligibility for federal student aid and often other forms of financial aid. 
How often will the FAFSA submission data be updated? 
From October through June , data releases are weekly. For the remainder of the calendar year , data releases occur every other Friday. (For high schools to track their progress, Federal Student Aid regularly updates estimates for the first 12 months of an application cycle. As of the 2017 18 FAFSA cycle, this is extended to the first 15 months of the application cycle and will cover October of one year through December of the following year.) 
Missing or Duplicate High Schools 

Why isn't my high school listed in these data files? 
There are two primary reasons that you may not see your school on the list. Your school will not appear on the report if there are fewer than five completed applications. Your school may appear on the report , but it may be listed under an alternative name. Since school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. It is possible this name is different than your formal school name. As a result , it is important to look for other variations of your school name and city. You do not need to request to be added to the list. Once a high school shows at least five completed FAFSA forms , their submission and completion totals will appear in the database. 
I cannot find my high school within the FAFSA form's high school search results. What could be causing this? How do I go about getting my school included? 
With a few exceptions discussed below , most high schools should be contained in our database on the FAFSA form. If you can t find your school , double - check your spelling of the city and school name , and then try your search again. Also , consider alternate names or cities that may be used. Sometimes the official location of the school reported to us is a suburb within a larger city, or vice - versa. If after trying various possibilities you still cannot find your institution , you may still continue forward by clicking next. Despite being unable to find your school , the information you type in will still be captured and recorded, so be sure the spelling is correct. For public schools , our database should contain every high school in the nation, unless the school was opened, merged, or otherwise changed its name within the past year or two. If you fit into one of these categories , your school may not be listed within the current FAFSA form, but will be listed on future FAFSA forms. For private schools , our database contains every high school that has participated in the U.S. Department of Education's Private School Survey. Visit the National Center for Education Statistics if your private school would like more information. If your private school only recently participated in the survey , your school may not be listed within the current FAFSA form, but will be listed on future FAFSA forms. 
Why do there appear to be duplicates of the same school? 
Since these school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. However , when we are unable to determine if school name variations are referring to the same school , we err on the side of caution and do not aggregate the data to a single record and applicant count. In that instance , it may appear that there are duplicates of the same school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you believe your school has been listed more than once. 
Low Completion Totals 

Why is my number of FAFSA submissions or completions lower than I think it should be? 
While we know that many high schools inadvertently overestimate their FAFSA completion rates , one reason your rates may be lower than expected is because your school could be listed more than once. This happens if students entered your school name in different ways on the FAFSA form. For instance , if some students listed " John Doe High School " and other students listed " Doe High School , " then your high school could be listed in more than one place. Please look for alternate names for your school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you find your school has been listed more than once. 
I am a high school counselor or college access professional. What resources do you have to help increase FAFSA completion totals? 
Federal Student Aid s Financial Aid Toolkit provides federal student aid information and outreach tools for counselors, college access professionals, nonprofit mentors, and others. The site helps counselors understand the basics of federal student aid, provides tips on hosting events along with sample PowerPoint presentations, provides suggested messages for social media and email outreach, and helps find other training opportunities. 
I am a counselor at a high school with a lot of students age 20 or older. Why are my numbers so low? 
Because there is no question on the FAFSA form that asks if an applicant is a high school senior , we must use several criteria to identify those applicants that are likely high school seniors. In this instance , the bulk of the students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date. Also , students must also be receiving their high school diploma, as opposed to a GED or other program, to fit this definition of a high school senior. 
Technical and Analytical 

The totals reported last year are different from the numbers reported now about last year. What is causing this? 
There could be several causes for this, including the possibility that your institution is listed more than once in the data using alternate variations of the school's name or city. One other cause is a change we made in 2017 to our definition of a high school senior, which now aligns with other data we publicly release. In past years, we used proxies to determine whether an applicant was a first - time filer ; we now use true first - time filer status as one criterion for being a senior. While this impacts a relatively small number of applicants, if your total decreased compared to what we reported last year , then this may mean there were applicants that had applied in a previous year. 
Can I add up all the submitted applications from a single state file to calculate a state total? What about adding up all the submitted applications from a single city? 
The answer to both questions is no. The official location of a school or the location most commonly reported by students may actually be a suburb falling within a larger city's limits. For example , adding up all the applications reported under " New York City " would exclude any institutions reported being within " Queens " or even within " Jamaica, " a smaller neighborhood within the New York City Borough of Queens. Any analysis must also consider the impact of withholding the totals or names of schools with fewer than five completed applications. At its most basic level , summing the number of applications reported in these files always underestimates the number of applications. If an institution is reported as having " <5 " completed applications , one cannot assume there were zero applications. Further , the totals for some schools are never made public because their class sizes essentially preclude them from having enough completed applications to ever be disclosed publicly. Because this impacts some areas more than others , be sure to consider these and other factors when conducting any analyses. 
Why do some districts appear in white on the maps? 
Districts are listed as missing / insufficient data if any of the following conditions are true : The regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate is missing e.g., if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009 10. A district has fewer than 15 students in the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate data. There s an unpredicted increase in the number of district graduating seniors e.g., a dramatic increase in the graduation rate, or if two districts merge under one district's name. A district has fewer than 10 projected graduates. A district has fewer than five completed FAFSA forms. The National Center Education Statistics Local Education Agency LEA code does not match the LEA code found in the Tiger / Line shapefile for the state. 

title : Program Reviews | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Program Reviews 
As part of its oversight duties , Federal Student Aid FSA routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that a school meets FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. During a program review , reviewers evaluate the school s compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the school must take to improve its future administrative capabilities. After completing a program review , Federal Student Aid issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school's response, and the Department s final determination. The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate; notifies the institution of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate; and closes the program review, if appropriate. The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the institution. Future FPRDs will be posted regularly. Below are the Final Program Review Determinations and Expedited Determination Letters issued in FY2019 FY2018 FY2017 FY2016 FY2015 FY2014 FY2013 To access all documents associated with focused - Clery Act reviews , visit the " Clery Act Reports " page. To locate Final Program Review Determinations from completed third - party servicer program reviews , visit the " Third - party Servicer Program Reviews " page. An overview of the top program review and audit findings by fiscal year is also available. These annual reports detail by frequency the most common findings identified in the annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, and identified through program reviews conducted by the Department of Education at institutions of higher education.

document : 
How to Correct or Update Your FAFSA Application 
Learn what types of corrections and updates you may make and how to make them. Most of the questions on the FAFSA form want to know your situation as of the day you sign the application. However , there are some instances in which you ll want to or be required to change the information you reported. 
What kinds of changes can I make to my FAFSA form once it s been processed? 

Corrections: If You Made a Mistake 
If you made a mistake in what you reported on the FAFSA form , you ll need to make a correction. Find out how to make changes to your FAFSA information. 
Corrections: If You Filed a FAFSA Form Using an Incorrect Social Security Number (SSN) 
If you filed a FAFSA form using an incorrect SSN , you can correct your SSN by doing one of the following : Recommended method : You can submit a new online FAFSA form. In many cases , this is the easiest and fastest option. Note: Submitting a new FAFSA form will change the date your FAFSA form was submitted and processed. Be sure to check your state or school deadlines, because your FAFSA submission date must meet those deadlines in order for you to qualify for state or school aid. You can ask the financial aid office at one of the schools listed on your Student Aid Report SAR to change your SSN for you. Least efficient method: You can change your SSN on your paper SAR, sign it, and mail it to the address provided on the SAR. This can take two to three weeks to process. Note: The SSN can t be changed through the paper SAR more than once. 
Updates: If Your Situation Has Changed 
Most information cannot be updated because it must be accurate as of the day you originally signed your FAFSA form. For example , if you spent some of your savings after filing the FAFSA form , you may not update your information to show a change in that amount. You should speak to the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend if there will be a significant change in your or your parent s income for the present year or if your family has other circumstances that cannot be reported on the FAFSA form. You may update your mailing address, email address, and other contact information if it has changed. There are certain items that you must update : You must update anything that changes your dependency status for instance, you are now pregnant or are now in legal guardianship except a change in your marital status. If your marital status changes , you must speak to the financial aid office to determine whether you may update the FAFSA form. If and only if you are selected for verification , you must update your FAFSA form if there is a change in the number of family members in your parents household or in your household. If the number of family members changes as a result of a change in your the student s marital status , you must speak to the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend to determine whether you may update the FAFSA form. If and only if you are selected for verification , you must update your FAFSA form if there is a change in the number of people in your parents household who are in college or the number of people in your household who are in college. If the number of people in college changes as a result of a change in your the student s marital status , you must speak to the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend to determine whether you may update the FAFSA form. 
Changes to Federal School Codes: If You Want to Add or Delete a School 
If you want to make your FAFSA information available to an additional school after filing the FAFSA form , you may add that school s Federal School Code. Note: No more than 10 schools may be listed on your FAFSA form at one time. The FAFSA PDF has space for only four schools, while the online FAFSA form and the myStudentAid mobile app allow 10 to be listed. If you add an eleventh school , the new school code overwrites a previous school code. You may choose which school to replace with the new school. The school removed from the list will not have automatic access to any new information you provide after you ve removed that school. 
How do I make changes to my FAFSA form? 
You can make changes in one of the following ways : Make changes at fafsa.gov : Select the " LOG IN button and enter your FSA ID. On the " My FAFSA " page , select " Make FAFSA Corrections. Create a save key. Change your information. Submit your new information. Write in the corrections or updates on your paper SAR, sign it, and mail it to the address provided on the SAR. Check with the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend ; the school might be able to make changes for you electronically. Note : Tax return information you transfer via the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool cannot be changed on your online FAFSA form. If you filed a 1040X amended return , contact your school s financial aid office to discuss whether it would be appropriate for the school to adjust the information on your FAFSA form.

A great way to get a feel for a school is to contact the school and schedule a visit, preferably while classes are in session. Be sure to bring a list of questions to ask. If you re in high school , ask your school counselor what information he or she has about the schools that interest you. Visit your state higher education agency s website to learn more about colleges and universities in your state. Your education is a major investment, so find out as much information as you can before you enroll. And because each school may offer different financial aid packages , you should consider applying to more than one school. For more information about what you should be doing to get ready for college , use our checklists for help. 
What should I consider when comparing schools? 
As you research colleges and career schools , consider such factors as cost, location, accreditation, and more. To find the information listed on this page for a specific school , check the school s website or search for the school using the U.S. Department of Education s college search tool, College Navigator. 
School Costs and Net Price 
School costs can be one of the most important factors in choosing potential colleges or career schools and costs can vary significantly from school to school. Learn about what is included in the cost of college and ways to reduce college costs. Any school that participates in the federal student aid programs is required to provide information on its cost of attendance and to offer a net price calculator on its website. Searching for a school s net price calculator is easy. This calculator will give you an idea of how much a program may cost after subtracting any financial aid. You can look up the cost and assess the value of colleges using the College Scorecard. 
Financial Aid 
Many students worry that tuition and the other costs of continuing their education will be out of reach. But don t let the potential costs stop you. Most students receive some kind of financial aid , and a few students even get a free ride, with all their costs covered. You should learn about financial aid including grants, scholarships, work - study, and loans. Always apply for all types of aid for which you might qualify, and meet all deadlines! Creating and managing a budget is a way to keep track of your income and expenses and save for your goals. 
Admission Requirements 
Different schools have different admission requirements. Learn exactly what a school requires by visiting its website or checking in with its admissions office. Many U.S. colleges require that students submit standardized test scores as part of their application packages. For most undergraduate programs , you ll have to take either the SAT or the ACT Test. 
Accreditation 
An accredited school meets certain standards set by an independent agency. It helps ensure the training or education you get meets employer standards in a specific field. If you attend a school that isn t accredited , you might not be able to get any financial aid. Use our accreditation search page to check a particular school s standards or to find an accredited school in a particular field or location. A diploma mill is an unaccredited school or a business claiming to be a school that awards a degree without requiring classwork that meets college - level standards. Some will send a diploma without you doing any work at all if you pay a fee. Others assign classwork that is so easy that your resulting degree is worthless, compared to a degree from an accredited school, and it won t help you get a good job. Learn more about diploma mills and how to avoid them. 
Enrollment Contracts 
Read any school enrollment contract carefully before you sign it. The contract explains what the school will give you for your money. If a school representative promises you something such as help finding a job that s not in the contract , ask the representative to write that promise into the contract and have it signed and dated. A promise is usually not enforceable unless it s in writing. 
Refund Policies 
Find out the school s tuition refund policy. If you enroll but never begin classes , you should get most of your money back. If you begin attending classes but leave before completing your course work , you might be able to get some of your money back. Also find out the school s return - of - aid policy. If you receive federal student aid except for Federal Work - Study and you withdraw from school , some of that money might have to be given back to the source by you or by your school. Even if you don t finish your course work , you ll have to repay the loan funds you received, minus any student loan funds your school has returned to the U.S. Department of Education. Learn more about repaying federal student loans. 
Past Complaints and Reputation 
Just because a school participates in the federal student aid programs doesn t mean we ve endorsed the quality of education the school offers. To find out whether there have been any complaints about the school , contact your local Better Business Bureau, state higher education agency, or the consumer protection division of your state attorney general s office. Check with the agency that licenses or accredits the school to see whether it meets required standards.

Protect Your Identity 

Reduce Your Risk of Identity Theft When Applying for Aid 
Identity theft can occur when criminals access personal data such as names, Social Security numbers, and bank and credit card information. Using the stolen data , the criminal can illegally obtain credit cards, set up mobile phone accounts, and more. Take the following precautions to reduce your risk when applying for federal student aid : Apply for federal student aid by filling out the FAFSA form at the official website or on our myStudentAid mobile app. After completing the FAFSA form online, exit the application and close the browser ; any cookies created during your session will be deleted automatically. Don t tell anyone your FSA ID username or password, even if that person is helping you fill out the FAFSA form. Review your financial aid offers and keep track of the amounts you applied for and received. Never give personal information over the phone or internet unless you made the contact. If you have questions about an offer of aid or about your student loan account , ask your college or contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center. We securely store your information within the National Student Loan Data System NSLDS database and provide access to it when you log in to your account. However , if you complete or even request a student loan application from a lender , you may be granting the lender permission to access your file. Before providing personal information to an organization , review its privacy policy. Keep receipts and documents for example, credit applications or offers, checks and bank statements with personal information in a safe place, and shred them when you are finished with them. Keep your purse or wallet safe at all times; store it and other items containing personal information in a secure place at home, especially if you have roommates. Immediately report all lost or stolen identification to the issuer e.g., the credit card company or your state s Department of Motor Vehicles and to the police, if appropriate. 
Change Your FSA ID Password If It Has Been Shared 
Log in to your account using your username and password. Once logged in , change your Account Information in your account settings. You ll be prompted to enter your current password and choose a new password. Be sure to keep track of your new password and do not share it with anyone!

If you cannot log in because you do not know your current username and/or password , retrieve your lost credentials. Note: To retrieve your username or password , you ll either need to have a code sent to your mobile phone or your email address , or you ll need to answer your challenge questions. If a student loan debt relief company had access to your FSA ID , it s possible that they may have changed the email address or phone number associated with your account. If you don t have access to or haven t verified the mobile phone number or email address associated with your FSA ID, and you don t know the answers to your challenge questions , you will have to contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1 - 800 - 433 - 3243.

Beware of Student Loan Debt Relief Companies 

Identify a Student Loan Scam 
Borrowers have reported receiving phone calls, emails, letters, and/or texts offering them relief from their federal student loans or warning them that student loan forgiveness programs would end soon. Usually , the so - called student loan debt relief companies offering these types of services don t offer any relief at all. Often they re just fraudsters who are after your money. Here are some examples of the false claims made in these communications : Act immediately to qualify for student loan forgiveness before the program is discontinued. You are now eligible to receive benefits from a recent law that has passed regarding federal student loans, including total forgiveness in some circumstances. Federal student loan programs may change. Please call within 30 days of receiving this notice. Your student loans may qualify for complete discharge. Enrollments are first come, first served. Student alerts : Your student loan is flagged for forgiveness pending verification. Call now! Communications using this type of aggressive advertising to lure borrowers are NOT coming from the U.S. Department of Education ED or its partners. Here are some signs to help you identify a scam by a student loan debt relief company : They require you to pay up - front or monthly fees for help. It is illegal to charge an up - front fee for this type of service , so if a company requires a fee before they actually do anything, that s a huge red flag especially if they try to get your credit card number or bank account information. In some cases , they may even step in and ask you to pay them directly, promising to pay your servicer each month when your bill comes due. Free assistance is available through your federal loan servicer. They promise immediate and total loan forgiveness or cancellation. No one can promise immediate and total loan forgiveness or cancellation. Most government forgiveness programs require many years of qualifying payments and/or employment in certain fields before your loans can be forgiven. Also , student loan debt relief companies do not have the ability to negotiate with your federal loan servicer for a special deal under the federal student loan programs. Payment levels under income - driven payment plans are set by federal law. They ask for your FSA ID username and password. ED or its partners will never ask you for your FSA ID password. Your FSA ID is used to sign legally binding documents electronically. It has the same legal status as a written signature. Do not give your FSA ID password to anyone or allow anyone to create an FSA ID for you. If a company has access to your FSA ID information , they can make changes to your account without your permission. They ask you to sign and submit a third - party authorization form or a power of attorney. These are written agreements giving the third party legal permission to talk directly to your federal loan servicer and make decisions on your behalf. Debt relief companies often want these authorizations so that they can change your account and contact information , so you don t realize that they aren t actually paying your monthly student loan bill. They claim that their offer is limited and encourage you to act immediately. Student loan debt relief companies often try to instill a sense of urgency by citing new laws or discontinuing programs as a way to encourage borrowers to contact them immediately. While there are some deadlines you need to meet regarding your student loans for instance , if you re paying under an income - driven repayment plan , you need to recertify annually our programs are limited only by the eligibility requirements. Their communications contain spelling and grammatical errors. While many of the communications sent out by these companies look very formal for example, fold - and - tear letters with safety patterns , they often contain spelling and grammatical errors. If you notice unusual capitalization, improper grammar, or incomplete sentences in the communication you receive , that s likely a red flag that the company is not affiliated with ED. For more tips on identifying a student loan scam , visit the Federal Trade Commission s website. 
How Student Loan Debt Relief Companies Work 
Student loan debt relief companies are private companies that provide or claim to provide student loan management services for a fee. Often these companies are charging for services you can easily manage yourself. They will say they can help reduce your monthly payment or get your loans forgiven , but after you pay, you might be worse off. You might not get the promised help or your money back , and the company may have made changes to your loan repayment plan that you didn t authorize or want. If you stopped paying your loans , your credit could be damaged and your loan balances could balloon. The tricky part is that, although these companies are not affiliated with ED, they sometimes claim to be. In their communications , these companies will claim to work with the U.S. Department of Education or claim to be consumer advocacy groups. In an effort to appear legitimate , some of these companies may even include your loan balance information in their communications. Remember : ED and our federal loan servicers will never charge fees to help borrowers with their student loans. If you re asked to pay an up - front or maintenance fee , you re not dealing with ED, so do not share your information. If you re not sure whether you can trust a company that contacts you , refer to this list of trusted companies that work with ED to provide student loan services. 
List of Companies Banned From Debt Relief 
The Federal Trade Commission FTC and other government entities have taken action against many of these companies. The problem is, many student loan debt relief companies operate under many different names and use many different phone numbers to avoid detection. Some even go as far as to reopen under different names after being sued or shut down. That s why it s important that you consult our list of trusted partners, and take steps to avoid these scams. View the FTC s list of companies and people banned from debt relief. 
Report Fraud and Identity Theft

If you suspect that your student information has been stolen , it is important to act quickly. These offices will help you determine what steps to take depending on your situation : ED s Office of Inspector General Fraud Hotline Federal Trade Commission Social Security Administration Equifax Credit Bureau Experian Information Solutions TransUnion Credit Bureau 
Report Student Loan Debt Relief Companies 
If you have already shared your information or paid a student loan debt relief company , you should do the following : Contact your federal loan servicer to revoke any power of attorney or third - party authorization agreement that your servicer has on file. You should also make sure no unwanted actions were taken on your loans. Contact your bank or credit card company, and request that payments to the company be stopped. File a complaint with the FTC. File a report of suspicious activity through our Feedback Center. Also , be sure to log in and change your account password. Do NOT share your new account password with anyone!

Who s My Student Loan Servicer? 
Learn about the role that student loan servicers play in the repayment process and which servicer handles your federal student loans.

Loan Servicer Assignment 
We will assign your loan to a loan servicer after your loan amount is first disbursed paid out. Your loan servicer will contact you after that. 
Identifying Your Servicer 
The following are loan servicers for loans that the U.S Department of Education ED owns. To find out who your loan servicer is , call the Federal Student Aid Information Center FSAIC at 1 - 800 - 433 - 3243. 
Whom to Contact for Loan Information 
If your loan is for the current or upcoming school year , contact your school s financial aid office directly for information about loan status, the timeframes for cancelling all or part of your loan or loan disbursement , and loan disbursement amounts and timing. Only your school's financial aid office can provide this information. If your loan was disbursed in a past school year and you re still in school , keep your contact information up to date with your school and contact your loan servicer when you withdraw, graduate, drop below half - time enrollment , or stop going to school.

Understanding Loan Transfers 
In some cases , we need to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer. If we transfer your federal student loans from one servicer to another servicer , your loans will still be owned by ED. The transfer to another servicer simply means that a new servicer will provide the support you need to fully repay your loans. Here s what you should expect if your loan is transferred to a new servicer : You will receive an email or a letter from your assigned servicer to inform you about the transfer. You will receive a welcome letter from the new servicer after the new servicer receives your loans. This notice will provide you with the contact information for the new servicer and inform you of actions that you may need to take. All of your loan information will be transferred from your assigned servicer to your new servicer , but you may only be able to see online information that covers the period since your new servicer took your loans over. There will be no change in the terms of your loans. Your previous loan servicer and new loan servicer will work together to make sure that all payments you make during the transfer process are credited to your loan account with the new servicer. After you receive the welcome letter from your new servicer , you should do the following : Begin sending your loan payments to your new servicer. If you use a bank or bill paying service to make your loan payments , update the new servicer s contact information with the bank or bill paying service. Follow the new servicer s instructions for creating an online account so that you can more easily communicate with the new servicer and keep track of your loan account. 
Avoid Paying for Federal Student Loan Assistance 
You don t have to pay to receive help with loan services such as consolidating your federal student loans or applying for an income - driven repayment plan. If you are contacted by a company asking you to pay enrollment, subscription, or maintenance fees to enroll you in a federal repayment plan or forgiveness program , you should walk away. These services and more can be completed by your servicer for free! Want to learn more? Read our blog post called Don t Be Fooled: You Never Have to Pay for Student Loan Help.

title : Gainful Employment | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Gainful Employment Information 
Generally , in order to be eligible for funding under the Higher Education Act Title IV student assistance programs , an educational program must lead to a degree at a non - profit or public institution or it must prepare students for " gainful employment in a recognized occupation. " Therefore , with very few exceptions , any non - degree program offered by non - profit or public institutions and all educational programs offered at for - profit institutions must lead to gainful employment. Subpart Q of the Student Assistance General Provisions establishes Debt - to - Earnings rates D / E rates to determine whether a gainful employment GE program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. A D / E rate is based on the typical loan debt and earnings of a cohort of the program s former students who completed the program, usually those who completed during a two - year period concluding two years prior to the D / E rate calculation year. This delay is to account for the ramping up of the students earnings upon completion of the program. Two D / E rates, the Annual Earnings Rate and the Discretionary Income Rate, are calculated for each program as a measure of the ability of program completers to reasonably repay the educational debt incurred for their attendance in the program. For the Annual Earnings Rate , the numerator is the calculated annual loan payment amount an estimate of the annual loan repayment amount based on the median educational debt of the members of the cohort. The denominator is the higher of the cohort s mean or median earnings obtained from the Social Security Administration SSA. The Discretionary Income Rate uses the same annual loan payment amount in the numerator as the Annual Earnings Rate but the denominator is the higher of the mean or median earnings minus 150% of the poverty guideline. Annual Earnings Rates of less than or equal to 8% are considered passing rates. Annual Earnings Rates greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% are zone rates , and Annual Earnings Rates greater than 12% are failing rates. For the Discretionary Income Rate , rates less than or equal to 20% are passing rates, rates greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% are zone rates , and rates greater than 30% are failing rates. 
Debt-to-Earnings (D/E) Rate Data 
D / E rate data is available for the 2015 debt measure year. Information on the Debt to Earnings data spreadsheet includes institution information, program information, D / E Annual Earnings Rates and D / E Discretionary Income Rates including transitional rates for relevant programs with the numbers used to calculate those rates, earnings data, and program appeal status. On April 25 , 2018, program appeal status information was updated to reflect decisions made to date ; some appeals remain subject to review and, consequently, no decisions have been made. Appeals classified as abandoned represent those instances in which a school submitted a notice of intent to appeal but did not subsequently submit required information by the deadline. Appeals classified as approved are instances in which the schools met the requirements for the U.S. Department of Education to grant the program appeals. As of April 25 , 2018 , no appeals that have been reviewed have been denied. On the spreadsheet , a single asterisk * indicates that the information presented in the field has changed from what was presented prior to the April 25 , 2018, update. A double asterisk * * indicates that the program rates were recalculated after the final rates were issued to correct for errors in the data reported to the NSLDS database.

Earnings Data 
As described above , the SSA calculates and returns to the U.S. Department of Education the Department the mean and median annual earnings of a cohort of students who completed the GE program during a specified cohort period. At least 10 completers from a program must be matched for SSA to return mean and median earnings information for disclosure purposes, while there must be at least 30 students in the cohort sent to SSA for the Department to calculate D / E rates. In calculating a GE program's D / E rates , the Department uses the higher of the SSA - reported mean or median earnings. SSA does not provide the Department individual earnings data or the identity of any students. Earnings data from the 2014 calendar year is available for informational purposes only. Information on the GE program earnings data spreadsheet includes OPEID and institution name, program identifiers Classification of Instructional Program CIP code, credential level, and CIP code program name, the number of completers matched with earnings data by SSA, along with both the mean and median SSA earnings for the GE program.

Information About the Gainful Employment Downloadable Spreadsheet 
The 2011 Gainful Employment Downloadable Spreadsheet provides the public with information about educational programs that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation GE Program. Under the regulations that go into effect on July 1 , 2012, the US Department of Education calculates metrics for GE Programs each year. These metrics include a Repayment Rate, two Debt - to - Earnings Ratios, and three student loan medians. The 2011 GE Informational Rate information included on the downloadable spreadsheet was produced for the purpose of providing institutions with preliminary information they can use to assess their GE Programs in preparation for the official gainful employment metrics that will first be calculated in 2013. These FY 2011 GE Informational Rates are for informational purposes only and, as such, do not invoke any regulatory requirements, sanctions, or other adverse action. These informational rates were prepared in advance of the years in which programs that fail the debt measures will be required to provide debt warnings and may lose eligibility after failing three out of four consecutive years. The 2011 GE Informational Rates were not calculated for a GE Program if the program had 30 or fewer former students in the relevant two - year period. Beginning next year , official gainful employment debt measures will include small programs using a four - year period if that four - year period results in more than 30 former students for the GE Program. After publishing the informational rates , the Department determined that the posted Median Title IV Loans amount reflected student debt information from the most recent loan award year, but did not include debt information from previous years. On October 25 , 2012 , the Department posted an updated spreadsheet. Column V reflects the median loan debt over the course of enrollment in a program. Column W reflects the one - year median loan debt. The Median Private Loans, Median Institutional Loans, and Median Title IV Loans were calculated for disclosure purposes and are NOT the medians that were used in the Repayment Rate or Debt - to - Earnings Ratio calculations. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER : The 2011 Gainful Employment Informational Rates were prepared to provide institutions with preliminary data about the performance of their GE Programs. The calculation of the 2011 Gainful Employment Informational Rates did not include a process for institutions to receive draft debt measures and to submit challenges, as the institutions will for official rate calculations. For these reasons , the 2011 Informational Rates are not intended to form a basis for making any general or specific assumptions or determinations about specific GE Programs, or in making projections about future years' rates.

title : Federal Versus Private Loans | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
When it comes to paying for college, career school, or graduate school, federal student loans can offer several advantages over private student loans. 
Need a loan to help pay for college? Consider federal loans first! If you apply for financial aid , your school will likely include student loans as part of your financial aid package. It s important to understand what types of loans you are offered. Generally , there are two types of student loans federal and private. Federal student loans and federal parent loans : These loans are funded by the federal government. Private student loans: These loans are nonfederal loans, made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or a school. 
If you need to borrow money to pay for college or career school, start with federal loans. 
Federal student loans are Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Federal parent loans are Direct PLUS Loans for parents. Parents are fully responsible for paying these loans, even though they are taken out to benefit students. 
What are the differences between federal and private student loans? 
Federal student loans are made by the government, with terms and conditions that are set by law, and include many benefits such as fixed interest rates and income - driven repayment plans not typically offered with private loans. In contrast , private loans are made by private organizations such banks, credit unions, and state - based or state - affiliated organizations, and have terms and conditions that are set by the lender. Private student loans are generally more expensive than federal student loans. The chart below provides a summary of the differences. Private loans differ by lender and by type of loan. Be sure you understand the terms of your loan, and keep in touch with your lender about any questions you may have. 
How do I get a federal student loan? 
To get a federal loan , you must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. Learn more about applying for aid.

title : Regaining Eligibility | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Have you been told you can t get federal student aid any longer? 
In most circumstances , there are things you can do to get back your eligibility for financial aid. You might lose federal student aid eligibility for a number of reasons. For instance , you might no longer meet one of the basic eligibility criteria , or you might have changed majors and no longer be enrolled in a program that makes you eligible to receive a specific type of funding for instance, a Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education [TEACH] Grant. We recommend you talk to your financial aid office about those and any other circumstances that cause you to lose eligibility. Meanwhile , below we provide some tips on how to get your eligibility back if you find yourself in one of the following situations : 
What if I defaulted on my student loan but now I want to get more federal student aid? 
You ll need to get out of default before you can receive aid again. 
What if my grades slipped, or I haven t completed enough credits, and my financial aid office told me I can t get federal student aid? 
You need to make satisfactory academic progress in college or career school in order to keep getting federal student aid. Talk to your school about whether you can appeal the decision that made you ineligible to continue receiving federal student aid. 
What if I was an eligible noncitizen but my status expired or was revoked? 
You ll need to reinstate the status that made you an eligible noncitizen, or become a citizen or permanent resident, before you can receive federal student aid. For information about reinstating your status or becoming a citizen , contact U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
What if I was convicted of a drug offense but now I want to get more federal student aid? 
If you ve lost eligibility due to a conviction for a drug offense , and you are not scheduled to regain eligibility this academic year , it is possible to regain eligibility early. 
What if I m incarcerated? 
Your incarceration affects your eligibility for different types of aid in different ways. If you are ineligible for a particular type of student aid due to your incarceration , you ll need to wait until you re released before you can get that type of aid. 
What if I accidentally received more federal student loan or grant money than I was supposed to? 
In certain cases , you ll need to repay the amount that was beyond the maximum that you were allowed to receive. You can either repay the excess all at once , or you can make arrangements to repay it a bit at a time. Once you ve repaid or made arrangements to repay the excess , you ll be able to receive additional federal student aid assuming you haven t reached the maximum amounts for all programs for which you are otherwise eligible. In other cases , your financial aid office might be able to adjust the amount of money you ll be getting from another federal student aid program to make up for the excess you received. If you have questions about repaying aid or getting additional aid , talk to the financial aid staff at your school. 
What if I thought I had a high school diploma, but it turns out that I actually don t? 
This situation might arise if, for instance, your high school is a diploma mill a school that charges a student a fee and requires him or her to complete little or no course work to get the diploma. If you don t have a high school diploma or an equivalent such as a General Educational Development GED certificate , you ll need to talk to the financial aid office at your school to find out what to do. 
What if I was convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud to obtain federal student aid funds? 
You ll need to repay the funds to the U.S. Department of Education or in the case of a federal student loan to the holder or servicer of the loan. 
What if I have property subject to a judgment lien? 
If you have property subject to a judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States , you will have to pay your debt in full or make arrangements to pay the debt. 

title : Getting Out of Default | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Don t get discouraged if you're in default on your federal student loan. 
You have multiple options to get out of default. If you failed to make your payments on your federal student loan and now are in default , don t let the consequences of default affect your financial future. Find out how to get out of default. Stopped Collection Activity and Temporary 0% Interest as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief during the COVID-19 national emergency , the U.S. Department of Education ED has stopped collection activity on defaulted federally owned student loans and/or grant overpayments. In addition , interest is temporarily set at 0% on defaulted federally owned student aid debt. This 0% interest and stopped collections period will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020. You can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out about federal student aid flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency. One way to get out of default is to repay the defaulted loan in full , but that's not a practical option for most borrowers. The two main ways to get out of default are loan rehabilitation and loan consolidation. While loan rehabilitation takes several months to complete , you can quickly apply for loan consolidation. However , loan rehabilitation provides certain benefits that are not available through loan consolidation. Take a look at the chart below to compare the benefits of loan rehabilitation versus the benefits of loan consolidation. Loan Rehabilitation and Consolidation Comparison Chart * NOTE : We previously indicated that loan consolidation would result in removal of the record of default from a borrower s credit history. That cell of the table has now been corrected to indicate that loan consolidation will not result in removal of the record of default from the borrower s credit history. If you rehabilitate a defaulted loan , the record of the default will be removed from your credit history. However , your credit history will still show late payments that were reported by your loan holder before the loan went into default. If you consolidate a defaulted loan , the record of the default as well as late payments reported before the loan went into default will remain in your credit history. Late payments will remain on your credit report for seven years from when they were first reported. It s important that you fully understand loan rehabilitation and loan consolidation before making your decision. Learn more about loan rehabilitation and loan consolidation. Unless you make three voluntary, on - time, full monthly payments on a defaulted loan before you consolidate it , your choice of repayment plans for the new Direct Consolidation Loan will be limited to one of the income - driven repayment plans. If you make three voluntary, on - time, full monthly payments before consolidating , you can choose from any of the repayment plans available to Direct Consolidation Loan borrowers. 
Loan Rehabilitation 
One option for getting your loan out of default is loan rehabilitation. To start the loan rehabilitation process , you must contact your loan holder. If you re not sure who your loan holder is , you can log in and select View loan servicer details to get your loan holder s contact information. 
William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program 
To rehabilitate a defaulted Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan , you must agree in writing to make nine voluntary, reasonable, and affordable monthly payments as determined by your loan holder within 20 days of the due date, and make all nine payments during a period of 10 consecutive months. Under a loan rehabilitation agreement , your loan holder will determine a reasonable monthly payment amount that is equal to 15 percent of your annual discretionary income, divided by 12. Discretionary income is the amount of your adjusted gross income from your most recent federal income tax return that exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline amount for your state and family size. You must provide documentation of your income to your loan holder. If you can t afford the initial monthly payment amount described above , you can ask your loan holder to calculate an alternative monthly payment based on the amount of your monthly income that remains after reasonable amounts for your monthly expenses have been subtracted. You ll need to provide documentation of your monthly income and expenses, including a completed Loan Rehabilitation: Income and Expense Information form. Depending on your individual circumstances , this alternative payment amount may be lower than the payment amount you were initially offered. To rehabilitate your loan , you must choose one of the two payment amounts. Depending on your income , your monthly payment under a loan rehabilitation agreement could be as low as $5. Your loan holder may be collecting payments on your defaulted loan through wage garnishment or Treasury offset taking all or part of your tax refunds or other government payments. These involuntary payments may continue even after you begin making payments under a loan rehabilitation agreement , but they can t be counted toward the required nine voluntary loan rehabilitation payments. Involuntary payments may continue to be taken until your loan is no longer in default or until you have made some of your rehabilitation payments. Once you have made the required nine payments , your loans will no longer be in default. 
Federal Perkins Loan Program 
To rehabilitate a defaulted Federal Perkins Loan , you must make a full monthly payment each month, within 20 days of the due date, for nine consecutive months. Your required monthly payment amount is determined by your loan holder. Find out where to go for information about your Perkins Loan. 
Benefits of Loan Rehabilitation 
When your loan is rehabilitated , the default status will be removed from your loan , and collection of payments through wage garnishment or Treasury offset will stop. You ll regain eligibility for benefits that were available on the loan before you defaulted, such as deferment, forbearance, a choice of repayment plans, and loan forgiveness , and you ll be eligible to receive federal student aid. Also , the record of default on the rehabilitated loan will be removed from your credit history. However , your credit history will still show late payments that were reported by your loan holder before the loan went into default. If you rehabilitate a defaulted loan and then default on that loan again , you can t rehabilitate it a second time. Rehabilitation is a one - time opportunity. 
Loan Consolidation 
Another option for getting out of default is to consolidate your defaulted federal student loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Loan consolidation allows you to pay off one or more federal student loans with a new consolidation loan. To consolidate a defaulted federal student loan into a new Direct Consolidation Loan , you must either agree to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven repayment plan, or make three consecutive, voluntary, on - time, full monthly payments on the defaulted loan before you consolidate it. Note: If you choose to make three payments on the defaulted loan before you consolidate it , the required payment amount will be determined by your loan holder, but cannot be more than what is reasonable and affordable based on your total financial circumstances. There are special considerations if you want to reconsolidate an existing Direct Consolidation Loan or Federal FFEL Consolidation Loan that is in default : To reconsolidate a defaulted Direct Consolidation Loan , you must also include at least one other eligible loan in the consolidation in addition to meeting one of the two requirements described above. If you have no other eligible loans that can be included in the consolidation , you cannot get out of default by consolidating a defaulted Direct Consolidation Loan. Your options are repayment in full or loan rehabilitation. You may reconsolidate a defaulted FFEL Consolidation Loan without including any additional loans in the consolidation, but only if you agree to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven repayment plan. If you include at least one other eligible loan in the consolidation , you re eligible to reconsolidate a defaulted FFEL Consolidation Loan if you meet either of the two requirements described above. In addition , if you want to consolidate a defaulted loan that is being collected through garnishment of your wages, or that is being collected in accordance with a court order after a judgment was obtained against you , you cannot consolidate the loan unless the wage garnishment order has been lifted or the judgment has been vacated. If you choose to repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under an income - driven plan , you must select one of the available income - driven repayment plans at the time you apply for the consolidation loan and provide documentation of your income. Note: If you want to consolidate a defaulted PLUS loan that you obtained as a parent to pay for your child s education , the only income - driven plan you can choose is the Income - Contingent Repayment Plan ICR. If you choose to make three consecutive, voluntary, on - time, full monthly payments on your defaulted loan before you consolidate it , you may repay the new Direct Consolidation Loan under any repayment plan you are eligible for. After your defaulted loan has been consolidated , your Direct Consolidation Loan will be eligible for benefits such as deferment, forbearance, and loan forgiveness. You ll also be eligible to receive additional federal student aid , but unlike loan rehabilitation, consolidation of a defaulted loan does not remove the record of the default from your credit history. Learn more about consolidation and how to apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan. 
Repayment in Full 
A third option for getting out of default is to repay the full amount of your defaulted student loan. If you need your loan holder s contact information to make a payment , log in and select View loan servicer details. 
Getting Help With Your Defaulted Loan 
If you need help with your defaulted loan , you will need to contact the holder of your defaulted loan. Find out who holds your loan by logging in and selecting View loan servicer details. Note : StudentAid.gov does not include information about any private student loans you may have received. Contact the loan holder of your private student loans for loan information.

title : Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
The U.S. Department of Education offers low-interest loans to eligible students to help cover the cost of college or career school. 
Students may be eligible to receive subsidized and unsubsidized loans based on their financial need. Subsidized and unsubsidized loans are federal student loans for eligible students to help cover the cost of higher education at a four - year college or university, community college, or trade, career, or technical school. The U.S. Department of Education offers eligible students at participating schools Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Some people refer to these loans as Stafford Loans or Direct Stafford Loans. 
What s the difference between Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans? 
In short , Direct Subsidized Loans have slightly better terms to help out students with financial need. Here s a quick overview of Direct Subsidized Loans : Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. Your school determines the amount you can borrow , and the amount may not exceed your financial need. The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on a Direct Subsidized Loan while you re in school at least half - time , for the first six months after you leave school referred to as a grace period * , and during a period of deferment a postponement of loan payments. *Note: If you received a Direct Subsidized Loan that was first disbursed between July 1 , 2012, and July 1 , 2014 , you will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during your grace period. If you choose not to pay the interest that accrues during your grace period , the interest will be added to your principal balance. Here s a quick overview of Direct Unsubsidized Loans : Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students ; there is no requirement to demonstrate financial need. Your school determines the amount you can borrow based on your cost of attendance and other financial aid you receive. You are responsible for paying the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods , your interest will accrue accumulate and be capitalized that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan. Try This Resource Federal Student Loans : Basics for Students Provides students with information on Direct Loans. Includes an overview of eligibility, the application process, and repayment. 
How much can I borrow? 
Your school determines the loan type, if any, and the actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year. However , there are limits on the amount in subsidized and unsubsidized loans that you may be eligible to receive each academic year annual loan limits and the total amounts that you may borrow for undergraduate and graduate study aggregate loan limits. The actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year may be less than the annual loan limit. These limits vary depending on what year you are in school and whether you are a dependent or independent student. If you are a dependent student whose parents are ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan , you may be able to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. The following chart shows the annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Notes: The aggregate loan limits include any Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans you may have previously received under the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program. As a result of legislation that took effect July 1 , 2010 , no further loans are being made under the FFEL Program. Effective for periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1 , 2012 , graduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate or professional students includes subsidized loans that a graduate or professional student may have received for periods of enrollment that began before July 1 , 2012, or for prior undergraduate study. If the total loan amount you receive over the course of your education reaches the aggregate loan limit , you are not eligible to receive additional loans. However , if you repay some of your loans to bring your outstanding loan debt below the aggregate loan limit , you could then borrow again, up to the amount of your remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limit. Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts each academic year beyond those shown above. For these students , there is also a higher aggregate limit on Direct Unsubsidized Loans. If you are enrolled in a health profession program , talk to the financial aid office at your school for information about annual and aggregate limits. Try This Resource Federal Student Loan Programs Lists federal student loan programs with loan details and award limits. 
Am I eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan? 
To receive either type of loan , you must be enrolled at least half - time at a school that participates in the Direct Loan Program. Generally , you must also be enrolled in a program that leads to a degree or certificate awarded by the school. Direct Subsidized Loans are available only to undergraduate students who have financial need. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to both undergraduates and graduate or professional degree students. You are not required to show financial need to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. 
How do I apply for a loan? 
To apply for a Direct Loan , you must first complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. Your school will use the information from your FAFSA form to determine how much student aid you are eligible to receive. Direct Loans are generally included as part of your financial aid package. 
What are the current interest rates? 
The interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are shown in the chart below. The interest rates shown above are fixed rates for the life of the loan. Got other questions about interest? Understanding interest rates and fees Find out how interest is calculated. Information for military members If you are a member of the military , you may be eligible for special interest benefits relating to your federal student loans. 
Is there a time limit on how long I can receive loans? 
If you are a first - time borrower on or after July 1 , 2013 , there is a limit on the maximum period of time measured in academic years that you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. If this limit applies to you , you may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. This is called your maximum eligibility period. Your maximum eligibility period is generally based on the published length of your current program. You can usually find the published length of any program of study in your school s catalog. For example , if you are enrolled in a four - year bachelor s degree program , the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is six years 150 percent of 4 years = 6 years. If you are enrolled in a two - year associate degree program , the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is three years 150 percent of 2 years = 3 years. Because your maximum eligibility period is based on the length of your current program of study , your maximum eligibility period can change if you change to a program that has a different length. Also , if you receive Direct Subsidized Loans for one program and then change to another program , the Direct Subsidized Loans you received for the earlier program will generally count toward your new maximum eligibility period. Certain types of enrollment may cause you to become responsible for the interest that accrues on your Direct Subsidized Loans when the U.S. Department of Education usually would have paid it. These enrollment patterns are described below. 
Other than interest, is there a charge for this loan? 
Yes , there is a loan fee on all Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The loan fee is a percentage of the loan amount and is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement. The percentage varies depending on when the loan is first disbursed, as shown in the chart below. Loans first disbursed prior to Oct. 1 , 2017, have different loan fees. 
What additional steps must I take to receive my loan? 
If your financial aid package includes federal student loans , your school will tell you how to accept the loan. If it is your first time receiving a Direct Loan , you will be required to complete entrance counseling , a tool to ensure you understand your obligation to repay the loan ; and sign a loan contract called a Master Promissory Note, agreeing to the terms of the loan. Contact the financial aid office at the school you are planning to attend for details regarding the process for receiving a loan at your school. 
How will I receive my loan? 
The school will first apply your loan funds to your school account to pay for tuition, fees, room and board, and other school charges. If any additional loan funds remain , they will be returned to you. All loan funds must be used for your education expenses. Learn more about the process of receiving federal student aid. 
Who will contact me after I receive my loan? 
When you receive your Direct Loan , you will be contacted by your loan servicer you repay your loan to the loan servicer. Your loan servicer will provide regular updates on the status of your Direct Loan, and any additional Direct Loans that you receive. 
When do I have to pay back my loan? 
After you graduate , leave school , or drop below half - time enrollment , you will have a six - month grace period before you are required to begin repayment. During this period, you'll receive repayment information from your loan servicer , and you'll be notified of your first payment due date. Payments are usually due monthly. Learn more about repaying your loan. 
What types of loan repayment plans are available? 
There are several repayment options available that are designed to meet the individual needs of borrowers. Your loan servicer can help you understand which repayment options are available to you. Generally , you ll have 10 to 25 years to repay your loan, depending on the repayment plan that you choose. Learn more about your repayment options. 
What if I have trouble repaying my loan? 
If you are unable to make your scheduled loan payments , contact your loan servicer immediately. Your loan servicer can help you understand your options for keeping your loan in good standing. For example , you may wish to change your repayment plan to lower your monthly payment or request a deferment or forbearance that allows you to temporarily stop or lower the payments on your loan. Learn more about deferment or forbearance options. 
Can I cancel a loan if I decide that I don t need it or if I need less than the amount offered? 
Yes. Before your loan money is disbursed , you may cancel all or part of your loan at any time by notifying your school. After your loan is disbursed , you may cancel all or part of the loan within certain time frames. Your promissory note and additional information you receive from your school will explain the procedures and time frames for canceling your loan.

Try This Resource The FAFSA Process graphic Walks through the process of preparing for, completing, and submitting a FAFSA form. Includes info on what happens after the form is submitted. 
Creating an FSA ID 
We strongly recommend you create an FSA ID, a username and password combination that allows you to sign your FAFSA form electronically. Your FSA ID also can be used to access the myStudentAid app, sign loan contracts, and access certain information online. While you can get your FSA ID as you re completing the FAFSA form online, getting it ahead of time and using it to begin your FAFSA form on fafsa.gov or on the myStudentAid mobile app cuts down on errors and delays. Find out how to get an FSA ID and what to do if you forgot your FSA ID. Important note: If you re a dependent student , one of your parents whose information is reported on the FAFSA form will also need an FSA ID so that he or she can sign your application electronically. If your parent doesn t have a Social Security number SSN , your parent won t be able to create an FSA ID which requires an SSN. This means you ll have to select the option to print a signature page when you get to the end of your FAFSA form on fafsa.gov this option isn t available in the myStudentAid app. Creating your FSA ID before you begin the FAFSA form only takes a few minutes and could prevent processing delays. Plus, you can t use the myStudentAid mobile app at all without an FSA ID, so you ll need to create it before filling out the FAFSA form on the app. Tip : Use your FSA ID to start your FAFSA form. When you create your FSA ID , be careful to enter your name and Social Security number exactly as they appear on your Social Security card. Then , if you go to fafsa.gov to start your application and indicate that you are the student , you will be given the option to enter your FSA ID or to enter your identifiers your name, date of birth, and SSN. If you log in with your FSA ID , certain information including your name, Social Security number, and date of birth will be automatically loaded into your application. This will prevent you from running into a common error that occurs when your verified FSA ID information doesn t match the information on your FAFSA form. Additionally , you won t have to provide your FSA ID again to sign your FAFSA form electronically or to use the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool IRS DRT if you re eligible. The student is the one applying for financial aid, so be sure it s the student entering his or her FSA ID in the I am the student tab. Do not start the FAFSA form by supplying the parent s FSA ID. 
Gathering the Documents Needed to Apply 
The FAFSA questions ask for information about you your name, date of birth, address, etc. and about your financial situation. Depending on your circumstances for instance, whether you re a U.S. citizen or what tax form you used , you might need the following information or documents as you fill out the application : Your Social Security number it s important that you enter it correctly on the FAFSA form! if you are a dependent student Your parents Social Security numbers if you have one Your driver s license number if you are not a U.S. citizen Your Alien Registration number Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information, for you and your spouse, if you are married, and for your parents if you are a dependent student : IRS 1040 Foreign tax return, IRS 1040NR, or IRS 1040NR - EZ Tax return for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau Records of your untaxed income , such as child support received , interest income , and veterans noneducation benefits , for you , if you are a dependent student and for your parents Information on cash; savings and checking account balances; investments, including stocks and bonds and real estate but not including the home in which you live; and business and farm assets for you, and for your parents if you are a dependent student Keep these records!

Starting Your FAFSA Form and Providing Your Basic Personal Information 
The FAFSA form is available on Oct. 1 for the next school year. We encourage you to fill it out as soon as possible on or after Oct. 1 to meet FAFSA deadlines. FAFSA Filing Options You may choose any of these methods to file a FAFSA form : Log in at fafsa.gov to apply online or Fill out the form in the myStudentAid mobile app, available on the App Store iOS or Google Play Android or Complete a 2020 - 21 FAFSA PDF or a 2019 20 FAFSA PDF note: you must print out and mail the FAFSA PDF for processing or Request a print - out of the FAFSA PDF by calling us at 1 - 800 - 4-FED - AID 1 - 800 - 433 - 3243 or 334 - 523 - 2691 TTY for the deaf or hard of hearing 1 - 800 - 730 - 8913 ; then fill out the form and mail it for processing If you are starting the application for the first time on fafsa.gov , select START HERE. As you begin , keep the following in mind : Your name and Social Security number must match those on your Social Security card. Follow this tip to avoid getting a notice that your information doesn t match the Social Security Administration s records or your FSA ID account. If you re concerned about providing your personal information on the log - in page , choose the virtual keyboard option for additional security. To ensure the application functions properly , make sure the pop - up blocker in your browser allows pop - ups from fafsa.ed.gov. Learn how to enable pop - ups in your browser. If you re starting for the first time on the myStudentAid mobile app , you will select START HERE and then be required to enter your FSA ID. You cannot fill out the FAFSA form on the mobile app without an FSA ID. If you re a male between the ages of 18 and 25 and you haven t registered with the Selective Service System , select Yes when you re asked if you would like to be registered. Otherwise , you won t be eligible to receive federal student aid. This requirement applies to any person assigned the sex of male at birth. The following tips apply whether you re filling out the form online or on the mobile app : Near the beginning of the application , you ll create a save key, a temporary password that you ll use if you start your FAFSA form, save it without finishing it, then want to open it again later to finish it. One benefit of the save key is that students and parents can use this function to access the FAFSA form if they are completing the FAFSA in separate locations. Unlike with the FSA ID, which needs to be kept private, it s okay to tell your parent what your save key is. If you are applying for a summer session , contact the financial aid office at your college to find out which school year you should select when you complete your FAFSA form. If you filled out a FAFSA form last year and want to renew it , select LOG IN on the FAFSA home page , select I am the student , enter your FSA ID , and be sure to select FAFSA RENEWAL once given the option. That way , many of the nonfinancial questions will be prefilled for you. Just be sure to update any information that has changed since last year. Only the student can start a FAFSA renewal using his or her FSA ID. If you re a dependent student and your parent helps you with your FAFSA form , you should start the FAFSA renewal, save it, and give the save key to your parent so he or she can access your FAFSA form. If you re using the mobile app and log in as the student and are eligible for a FAFSA renewal , the renewal will automatically appear for you. Due to the coronavirus national emergency , processing of the FAFSA PDF may take longer than usual. We recommend filing your FAFSA form electronically to avoid processing delays. 
Listing Colleges and/or Career Schools 
While completing the FAFSA form , you must list at least one school to receive your information. The schools you list will use your FAFSA information to determine the types and amounts of aid you may receive. Use the Federal School Code Search to find the colleges you re interested in including on your FAFSA form. For purposes of federal student aid , it does not matter in what order you list the schools. However , to be considered for state aid , some states require you to list schools in a particular order for instance, you might need to list a state school first. Find out whether your state has a requirement for the order in which you list schools on your FAFSA form You can list up to 10 schools online or in the mobile app or up to four schools on a FAFSA PDF. You can add more schools to your FAFSA form later. Schools you list on the application will automatically receive your FAFSA results electronically. Note : Schools will not be able to see which other schools you listed on your FAFSA form. You should add any school that you plan on applying to, even if you haven t been accepted yet. In most cases , once a school accepts you , they will then work on developing your aid offer. 
Determining Your Dependency Status 
The FAFSA form asks a series of questions that determine whether you are a dependent or independent student for purposes of applying for federal student aid. If you are a dependent student , you must report parent information, as well as your own information, on your application. If you re curious , you can find out now whether you re a dependent student. 
Reporting Parents Information 
If you re a dependent student , you ll need to report parent information on your FAFSA form. Visit our page on reporting parent information to find out who counts as your parent, what to do if you don t live with your parents, and what to do if you don t have access to your parents financial information. 
Providing Financial Information 
The FAFSA form asks for financial information, including information from tax forms and balances of savings and checking accounts. The 2020 21 FAFSA form asks for 2018 tax information. If you re filling out the 2019 20 FAFSA form , you ll need your 2017 tax information. Note: If your family s financial situation has changed dramatically since you and/or your parents filed taxes , complete the FAFSA questions as required, submit the FAFSA form , then contact the school you plan to attend and discuss your situation with the financial aid office. 
What to Do If Your Parents (or Your) Marital Status Has Changed Since Taxes Were Filed 
Here are some tips for this type of situation using the example of the 2020 21 FAFSA form : The FAFSA form asks for marital status as of today the day it s filled out. So if the student or parent is married now but wasn t in 2018 and therefore didn t file taxes as married , the spouse s 2018 income will need to be added to the FAFSA form. Similarly , if the student or parent filed 2018 taxes as married but is no longer married when filling out the FAFSA form , the spouse s income will need to be subtracted. And if the student or parent was married when filing 2018 taxes, then got divorced and is now married to someone else , there s a bit more math to do: Subtract the ex s income, then add the new spouse s income. The FAFSA help text covers all these situations in more detail as you re filling out the application. 
Automatically Transferring Your Tax Information Using the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) 
The IRS DRT automatically transfers tax information into the FAFSA form. Be sure to consider this option if it s offered to you. If you got an extension on filing your taxes and didn t file until September or October, find out when your tax return information will likely be available using the IRS DRT. Try This Resource Simple Steps to Transfer Tax Information Into Your FAFSA Form graphic Explains how to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to transfer tax information into the FAFSA form. Here s how the IRS DRT process works , assuming your tax information is available : The IRS DRT takes you to the IRS website, where you ll need to provide your name and other information exactly as you provided it on your tax return. Some information will be prepopulated from your FAFSA form. At the IRS site , you ll see a page that indicates that your tax information is available. For security and privacy protections, you won t see the actual information. You can choose to import your information into the FAFSA form , or you can cancel your request and return to the FAFSA site. If you choose to import your information into the FAFSA form , you ll find that on the FAFSA site, instead of your tax information being displayed, you ll see Transferred from the IRS " in the appropriate fields. You won t be able to make changes to those answers. Using the IRS DRT saves you time and effort : You don t have to find your tax records. You don t have to worry about making mistakes entering your tax information on your FAFSA form. You may not need to provide an IRS tax transcript or a signed copy of your income tax return if you re selected for verification. 
Can I change the tax return information that I transfer into the FAFSA form via the IRS DRT? 
No. Information you transfer via the IRS DRT can t be changed. Remember, the information transferred is coming from your filed tax return , so it shouldn t need to be changed. If your financial situation has changed or you filed a 1040X amended return , contact your school s financial aid office to discuss whether it would be appropriate for the school to adjust the information on your FAFSA form. 
If I ve transferred my tax return information into the FAFSA form via the IRS DRT, and then decide I want to enter the information manually instead, can I clear the information that was transferred via the DRT? 
We strongly discourage clearing the information. The IRS DRT remains the fastest, most accurate way to input your tax return information into the FAFSA form. Additionally , using the IRS DRT to enter your tax information into the FAFSA form may reduce the amount of paperwork you need to provide to your school later. If , despite this , you still want to clear the information transferred via the IRS DRT and enter your tax information manually and you haven t submitted the application or correction yet you can select the Reset FAFSA button at the top of the page or in the menu at the upper right of the mobile app screen.

Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) 
If you are employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not - for - profit organization , you might be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Keep reading to see whether you might qualify. Alert! If your PSLF application is denied because some or all of your payments were not made under a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF , you might still be eligible for forgiveness through Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Learn more. The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full - time for a qualifying employer. PSLF Resources Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Help Tool Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Employment Certification Form Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Application for Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program FAQ 
Qualifying for PSLF 
To qualify for PSLF , you must be employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not - for - profit organization ; work full - time for that agency or organization ; have Direct Loans or consolidate other federal student loans into a Direct Loan ; repay your loans under an income - driven repayment plan; and make 120 qualifying payments. To ensure you re on the right track , you should submit a Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form annually or when you change employers. We ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. 
Qualifying Employment 
Qualifying employment for the PSLF Program isn t about the specific job that you do for your employer. Instead , it s about who your employer is. Employment with the following types of organizations qualifies for PSLF : Government organizations at any level U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal Not - for - profit organizations that are tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code Serving as a full - time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program. The following types of employers do not qualify for PSLF : Labor unions Partisan political organizations For - profit organizations, including for - profit government contractors Contractors : You must be directly employed by a qualifying employer for your employment to count toward PSLF. If you re employed by an organization that is doing work under a contract with a qualifying employer , it is your employer s status not the status of the organization that your employer has a contract with that determines whether your employment qualifies for PSLF. For example , if you re employed by a for - profit contractor that is doing work for a qualifying employer , your employment does not count toward PSLF. Other types of not - for - profit organizations : If you work for a not - for - profit organization that is not tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it can still be considered a qualifying employer if it provides certain types of qualifying public services. However , in our experience , few organizations meet these criteria. 
Full-time Employment 
For PSLF , you re generally considered to work full - time if you meet your employer s definition of full - time or work at least 30 hours per week, whichever is greater. If you are employed in more than one qualifying part - time job at the same time , you will be considered full - time if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers. If you are employed by a not - for - profit organization , time spent on religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing may not be counted toward meeting the full - time employment requirement. 
Eligible Loans 
Any loan received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program qualifies for PSLF. Loans from these federal student loan programs don't qualify for PSLF: the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program and the Federal Perkins Loan Perkins Loan Program. However , they may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Student loans from private lenders do not qualify for PSLF. If you consolidate your loans , only qualifying payments that you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan can be counted toward the 120 payments required for PSLF. Any payments you made on the loans before you consolidated them don t count. The PSLF Help Tool will tell you whether you need to consolidate some or all of your loans. 
Qualifying Payments 
A qualifying monthly payment is a payment that you make after Oct. 1 , 2007 ; under a qualifying repayment plan ; for the full amount due as shown on your bill ; no later than 15 days after your due date ; and while you are employed full - time by a qualifying employer. You can make qualifying monthly payments only during periods when you re required to make a payment. Therefore , you can t make a qualifying monthly payment while your loans are in an in-school status, the grace period , a deferment , or a forbearance. If you want to make qualifying payments, but you re in a deferment or forbearance , contact your federal student loan servicer to waive the deferment or forbearance. Your 120 qualifying monthly payments don t need to be consecutive. For example , if you have a period of employment with a nonqualifying employer , you will not lose credit for prior qualifying payments you made. The best way to ensure that you are making on - time, complete payments is to sign up for automatic debit with your loan servicer. 
Can I qualify sooner by making higher monthly payments? 
No. If you make a monthly payment for more than the amount you are required to pay , you should keep in mind that you can receive credit for only one payment per month, no matter how much you pay. You can t qualify for PSLF faster by making larger payments. If you want to pay more than your required monthly payment amount , you should contact your servicer and ask that the extra amount not be applied to cover future payments. Otherwise, you may end up being paid ahead , and you can t receive credit for a qualifying PSLF payment during a month when no payment is due. 
What if I m in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, or my loans are being repaid by the U.S. Department of Defense? 
There are special rules that allow borrowers who are AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteers to use their Segal Education Award or Peace Corps transition payment to make a single lump - sum payment that may count for up to 12 qualifying PSLF payments. In addition , borrowers who have lump - sum payments made on their behalf under a student loan repayment program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense may also receive credit for more than one qualifying PSLF payment. 
Qualifying Repayment Plans 
Qualifying repayment plans include all of the income - driven repayment IDR plans plans that base your monthly payment on your income. While payments made under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan are qualifying payments , you would have to change to an IDR plan to benefit from PSLF. Under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , your loans will be paid in full once you have made the 120 qualifying PSLF payments and there will be no balance to forgive. Before you change to an IDR plan , however , you should understand that your payment may increase under these plans depending on your income and the amount that you owe. If this is the case for you, and you do not wish to pay this higher amount , then the PSLF Program may not benefit you. The following repayment plans do not qualify for PSLF : Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans Graduated Repayment Plan Extended Repayment Plan Alternative Repayment Plan 
PSLF Process 
Because you have to make 120 qualifying monthly payments , it will take at least 10 years before you can qualify for PSLF. Important : You must be working for a qualifying employer at the time you submit the application for forgiveness and at the time the remaining balance on your loan is forgiven. If you are working toward PSLF , you should complete and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form often referred to as the ECF annually or when you change employers. If you have made 120 qualifying payments , you should fill out and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Application for Forgiveness PSLF application. Either way , we ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. Alert! If you don t periodically submit the Employment Certification Form , then at the time you apply for forgiveness , you will be required to submit an Employment Certification Form for each employer where you worked while making the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Help Tool 
The PSLF Help Tool will help you understand more about the PSLF Program and what you need to do to participate and possibly have your loans forgiven ; help you assess whether your employer qualifies for PSLF ; help you assess whether your loans qualify for PSLF ; help you decide which PSLF form to submit ; and use the information we have about your federal student loans to explain other actions you should or must take if you want to receive PSLF. At this time , the PSLF Help Tool won t allow you or your employer to electronically sign the forms that the tool will generate for you. Therefore , after you complete the PSLF Help Tool process , you will need to print the PDF document that the tool generates, sign it yourself, have your employer sign it, and then submit the form to the PSLF servicer as instructed on the printed PDF document. 
Employment Certification Form Process 
After you submit an Employment Certification Form , your loans will transfer to the PSLF servicer. After the PSLF servicer determines how many qualifying payments you made during the period on your Employment Certification Form , you ll receive a letter telling you the number of qualifying payments you have made. The number of qualifying payments you have made will only be updated whenever you submit another Employment Certification Form or PSLF application that documents a new period of qualifying employment. You can find out how many qualifying payments you ve made by logging in to your account with the PSLF servicer and viewing your loan details or by looking on your most recent billing statement. 
Employment Certification 
Your employment can be certified by an official who has access to your employment or service records and is authorized by your employer to certify your employment or your service as an AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer. This will often be someone in the human resources department, though in some cases your direct supervisor or another individual may be authorized to certify your employment. Check with your organization to see who is allowed to certify your Employment Certification Form. 
Tax on Forgiveness 
Amounts forgiven under the PSLF Program are not considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore , you will not have to pay federal income tax on the amount of your Direct Loans that is forgiven. 
How to Submit PSLF Forms 
Send the completed form, with your employer s certification, to FedLoan Servicing, the U.S. Department of Education s federal loan servicer for the PSLF Program. You may mail the form to this address : U.S. Department of Education FedLoan Servicing P.O. Box 69184 Harrisburg, PA 17106 - 9184 You may also fax your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form to 717 - 720 - 1628. If FedLoan Servicing is already your servicer , you may upload your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form on their website.

When You ll Receive Your Financial Aid 
The type of aid you accepted affects when you ll get your aid. 
Grants and Student Loans 
Generally , your school will give you your grant or loan money in at least two payments called disbursements. In most cases , your school must give you your grant or loan money at least once per term semester, trimester, or quarter. Schools that don t use traditional terms such as semesters or quarters usually must give you your grant or loan money at least twice for instance, at the beginning and midpoint of your academic year or program. Note: If you re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child s education expenses , your loan funds will be disbursed according to the same type of schedule. The following may apply if you haven t taken out a federal student loan before : If you re a first - year undergraduate student and a first - time borrower , you may have to wait 30 days after the first day of your enrollment period semester, trimester, etc. before your school is allowed to give you your loan money. Check with your school to see whether this rule applies. If you re a first - time borrower of a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan , you must complete entrance counseling before your school can give you your loan money. If you are a graduate or professional student taking out a Direct PLUS Loan for the first time , you must complete entrance counseling before you receive your first loan disbursement. Note: Counseling isn t required if you re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child s education. 
Work-Study 
If you re going to have a work - study job , you ll be paid at least once a month. If you don t receive the type or amount of financial aid you expected , contact your school. The financial aid office can explain how your aid was determined. 
How You ll Receive Your Financial Aid 
How you ll get your aid depends on the type of aid you accepted. 
Grants and Student Loans 
Typically , the school first applies your grant or loan money toward your tuition, fees, and if you live on campus room and board. Any money left over is paid to you directly for other education expenses. If you get your loan money , but then you realize that you don t need the money after all , you may cancel all or part of your loan within 120 days of receiving it and no interest or fees will be charged. 
Work-Study 
Your school must pay you directly unless you request that the school send your payments directly to your bank account or use the money to pay for education - related charges e.g., tuition, fees, room and board on your student account. 
Direct PLUS Loans for Parents 
In most cases , your child s school will give you your loan money by crediting it to your child s school account to pay tuition, fees, room, board, and other authorized charges. If there is money left over , the school will pay it to you. In some cases , with your permission , the school may give the leftover money to your child. If you take out a loan as a student or parent , your school or your child s school will notify you in writing each time they give you any part of your loan money. At the same time , they ll provide information about how to cancel all or part of your loan if you find you no longer need the full amount. You will also receive a notice from your loan servicer confirming that you received the loan money. 
Paying for Textbooks and Other Course Materials If You Haven t Received Your Financial Aid 
Schools that participate in federal student aid programs must provide a way for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term if you are eligible for disbursement i.e., the payment of your financial aid 10 days before the term begins and you will have a credit balance i.e., money left over after your financial aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges as applicable. Your school can tell you if the above criteria apply to you. 
How Your School Gets Your Financial Aid Funds to You for Course Materials 
You should ask your financial aid office about this because it varies from school to school. For example , if the school offers a bookstore voucher or other means for students to receive their books and supplies through the school or its bookstore , you could obtain your materials that way. When your school gives you financial aid , sometimes money is left over after your aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges. This remaining amount is called a credit balance. If you have a credit balance , your school must pay this amount to you directly within 14 days unless you authorize the school to keep the money to pay for future institutional charges. The amount the school is required to provide is either the amount of your credit balance or the amount needed for books and supplies as determined by your school, whichever is less. Your school can tell you if this applies to you. Even if the school s preferred arrangement is to provide vouchers or other means for you to get your course materials through the school or its bookstore , the school must provide you the opportunity to opt out, receive a check from the school, and obtain the books and supplies on your own unless one of the following exceptions applies : The school can demonstrate a compelling health and safety reason for obtaining the materials through the institution or its supplier. The school can demonstrate that the materials are not currently available elsewhere or accessible to students via other means. Saving Money on Textbooks and Course Materials Depending on what materials are available at your school and for your courses , you may have several lower - cost options to obtain your books : If your course uses a hard - copy textbook , consider buying a used copy or renting your textbook from a bookstore or online. If you purchase your textbook , consider reselling that textbook, if allowed, when you are done with the course. Even with new textbooks , you may be able to save money by shopping around. Some schools use open - access texts and online content to offer students further savings over hard - copy textbooks. Open - access texts are available for free. If your course uses paid online content , your school may have negotiated a deal with the publisher that will allow you online access at a fraction of the cost you would pay for a physical book. The paid online content may also come with study tools and other content in addition to the textbook. Your options for course material formats will vary by school, instructor, and course, so learning what your options are and knowing about any cost - reduction initiatives your school may have can result in significant savings. A Note About ISBNs Your school must publish the International Standard Book Number ISBN for each course text in the online course schedule entry if the ISBN is available. The ISBN identifies the specific edition of the book that s required for your class and helps you be sure you re obtaining the right book when you search for it. If an ISBN is unavailable , the school should provide the author, title, publisher, and copyright date. 

title : Graduated Plan | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
The Graduated Repayment Plan starts with lower payments that increase every two years. 
Payments are made for up to 10 years between 10 and 30 years for consolidation loans. If your income is low now, but you expect it to increase steadily over time , this plan may be right for you. 
Eligible Federal Loans 
The following loans from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program are eligible for the Graduated Repayment Plan : Direct Subsidized Loans Direct Unsubsidized Loans Direct PLUS Loans Direct Consolidation Loans Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans FFEL PLUS Loans FFEL Consolidation Loans 
Monthly Payments for Federal Education Loans Except Consolidation Loans 
Under this plan , your monthly payments start out low and increase every two years , are made for up to 10 years for all loan types except Direct Consolidation Loans and FFEL Consolidation Loans , will never be less than the amount of interest that accrues between your payments , and won t be more than three times greater than any other payment. 
Monthly Payments for Consolidation Loans 
Under this plan , your monthly payments start out low and increase every two years , are made for a period of between 10 and 30 years for Direct Consolidation Loans and FFEL Consolidation Loans , will never be less than the amount of interest that accrues between your payments , and won t be more than three times greater than any other payment. If you have a Direct Consolidation Loan or FFEL Consolidation Loan , the length of your repayment period will depend on the amount of your total education loan indebtedness. This total education loan indebtedness includes the amount of your consolidation loan and your other student loan debt. Other student loan debt includes any federal student loans that are not included in the consolidation loan, as well as private education loans that are not eligible for consolidation. The maximum amount of other student loan debt that may be considered in determining your repayment period may not exceed the loan amount you are consolidating. To include other student loan debt in the determination of the repayment period for your Direct Consolidation Loan , be sure to list those loans on your consolidation application in the section for listing loans that you do not want to consolidate, but want considered in the determination of your repayment period. The chart below shows the maximum repayment period for a Direct Consolidation Loan or FFEL Consolidation Loan under the Graduated Repayment Plan depending on total education loan indebtedness. 
Using Loan Simulator to Estimate Your Eligibility and Payment Amount Under the Graduated Repayment Plan 
Your loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan, can help you choose a loan repayment plan that s best for you. Before you contact your loan servicer to discuss repayment plans , use our Loan Simulator to get an early look at what repayment plans you may be eligible for and to receive a comparison of estimated monthly payment amounts for all federal student loan repayment plans. This comparison is important because the Graduated Plan may not provide you with the lowest payment amount based on your individual circumstances. You may find that your payment will be lower under another repayment plan.

document : 
Student loan forbearance allows you to temporarily stop making payments. 
Find out if a forbearance is the best option for your situation. With forbearance , you won t have to make a payment , or you can temporarily make a smaller payment. However , you probably won t be making any progress toward forgiveness or paying back your loan. As an alternative , consider income - driven repayment. NEW : Automatic Suspension of Monthly Payments as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. This suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out what loans qualify and get additional information about this forbearance and other student loan flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency. 
Get Relief With Lower Payments on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan 
If you re having trouble repaying your loans due to circumstances that may continue for an extended period, or if you re unsure when you ll be able to afford to make your monthly loan payments again , a better option might be to change to an income - driven repayment plan. Income - driven repayment plans base your monthly payments on your income and family size. In some cases , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. They can also provide loan forgiveness if your loan is not paid in full after 20 or 25 years. Always contact your student loan servicer immediately if you re having trouble making your student loan payments. If you re seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF or income - driven repayment forgiveness , forbearance will not allow you to make progress toward forgiveness. 
Be Aware That Interest Might Accrue During a Forbearance 
If you are granted a forbearance , you are still responsible for paying the interest that accrues during the forbearance period. 
How It Works 
During a forbearance , you can either pay the interest as it accrues , or you can allow it to accrue and be capitalized added to your loan principal balance at the end of the forbearance period. If you don t pay the interest on your loan and allow it to be capitalized , the total amount you repay over the life of your loan may be higher. Unpaid interest is capitalized only on Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans. Unpaid interest is never capitalized on Federal Perkins Loans. 
Request a Forbearance 
Most types of forbearance are not automatic you need to submit a request to your student loan servicer, often using a form. Also , for some types of forbearance , you must provide your student loan servicer with documentation to show that you meet the eligibility requirements for the forbearance you are requesting. Learn more about requirements and how to access request forms. 
Understand Eligibility for a Forbearance 
There are two main types of forbearance: general and mandatory. 
General Forbearance

title : Dependency Status | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
For purposes of applying for federal student aid, what s the difference between a dependent student and an independent student? 
Read the definitions, find out who has to provide parent information on the FAFSA form, and learn what to do if you aren t in contact with your parents. Your dependency status determines whose information you must report on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. If you re a dependent student , you will report your and your parents information. If you re an independent student , you will report your own information and, if you re married, your spouse s. The federal student aid programs are based on the concept that it is primarily your and your family s responsibility to pay for your education. A dependent student is assumed to have the support of parents , so the parents information has to be assessed along with the student s, in order to get a full picture of the family s financial strength. If you re a dependent student, it doesn t mean your parents are required to pay anything toward your education ; this is just a way of looking at everyone in a consistent manner. 
Am I dependent or independent? 
Your answers to questions on the FAFSA form determine whether you are considered a dependent or independent student. The questions change a little from one year s application to the next year s ; for instance, the 2020 21 FAFSA form asks whether you were born before Jan. 1 , 1997, while the 2021 22 FAFSA form will ask whether you were born before Jan. 1 , 1998. Here are the questions that determine your dependency status, first in a graphic format and then for 2020 21 specifically in a table of dependency status questions : View text-only version 
Dependency Status Questions on the 2020 21 FAFSA Form 
* Answer " No " you are not a veteran if you 1 have never engaged in active duty including basic training in the U.S. armed forces , 2 are currently a Reserve Officers Training Corps ROTC student or a cadet or midshipman at a service academy , 3 are a National Guard or Reserves enlistee activated only for state or training purposes, or 4 were engaged in active duty in the U.S. armed forces but released under dishonorable conditions. Also answer No if you are currently serving in the U.S. armed forces and will continue to serve through June 30 , 2021. * Answer " Yes " you are a veteran if you 1 have engaged in active duty including basic training in the U.S. armed forces or are a National Guard or Reserves enlistee who was called to active duty for other than state or training purposes, or were a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies and 2 were released under a condition other than dishonorable. Also answer Yes if you are not a veteran now but will be one by June 30 , 2021. * * If you do not have a determination that you are homeless , but you believe you are an unaccompanied youth who is homeless or self - supporting and at risk of being homeless , answer No to the FAFSA questions concerning being homeless. Then contact your financial aid office to explain your situation. Homeless means lacking fixed or regular housing. You may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels, hotels, cars, or temporarily living with someone else because you have nowhere else to go. 
What if I answered "Yes" to one or more of the questions above? 
If so , then for federal student aid purposes , you re considered to be an independent student and will not provide information about your parents on the FAFSA form. 
What if I answered "No" to every question? 
If so , then for federal student aid purposes , you re considered to be a dependent student , and you must provide information about your parents on the FAFSA form. Not living with parents or not being claimed by them on tax forms does not make you an independent student for purposes of applying for federal student aid. Note : Law school and health profession students may be required to provide parent information regardless of their dependency status. The parent information is used in determining eligibility for programs such as Health Professions Student Loans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Try This Resource Am I Dependent or Independent? Worksheet to help students determine their dependency status when filling out the FAFSA form. 
Which parent s information should I report on the FAFSA form? 
If your legal parents are married to each other, or are not married to each other and live together , you should report information about both of them on your FAFSA form. Your legal parents are your biological or adoptive parents, or your parents as determined by the state for example, if the parent is listed on your birth certificate. However , we recognize that many situations are a little more complicated, so we ve provided information on how to figure out which parent should provide information on the FAFSA form. Try This Resource Who s My Parent When I Fill Out My FAFSA? Graphic that helps dependent students determine which parent's information to include on the FAFSA form. 
What if I don t live with my parents? 
You still must answer the questions about your parents if you re considered a dependent student. 
What if my parents aren t going to help me pay for college and refuse to provide information for my FAFSA form? 
You can t be considered independent of your parents just because they refuse to help you with this process. If you do not provide their information on the FAFSA form , the application will be considered rejected , and you might not be able to receive any federal student aid. The most you would be able to get depending on what the financial aid office at your college decides would be a loan called an unsubsidized loan. The FAFSA instructions will tell you what to do if you are in this situation. Learn more about how to fill out the FAFSA form when your parents aren t supporting you and won t provide their information. 
What if I have no contact with my parents? 
If you have no contact with your parents and don t know where they live , or you ve left home due to an abusive situation , fill out the FAFSA form and then immediately get in touch with the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. The financial aid staff will tell you what to do next. Learn more about how to fill out the FAFSA form if you have special circumstances that prevent you from providing parent information. 

title : Accepting Aid | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Accepting Financial Aid 
First , accept the financial aid funds you don t have to pay back. When your school financial aid office sends you an aid offer , they ll ask you to indicate which financial aid you want. Look carefully at your options and make an informed decision. 
Choosing the Best Financial Aid to Accept 
Keep the following in mind when you get an aid offer and are deciding which aid is the best to accept : Free money first e.g., scholarships, grants Earned money second e.g., work - study Borrowed money last e.g., federal student loans Start from the top of this table and work your way down : Many schools also offer tuition payment plans a monthly interest - free payment toward tuition. This type of plan may help reduce the amount you need to take out in loans. Ask your financial aid office if such a plan is available. 
Deciding Which Student Loans to Accept 
If you must accept loans , accept the ones with the most favorable terms and conditions. Usually , that means choosing the federal student loans offered to you. If you are considering getting a state loan, school loan, or private student loan , you should learn about the differences between federal and other loans. If you have any questions or don t understand what types of loans are in your aid offer , contact the school. Make sure you understand what you re accepting and the repayment terms. Borrow only what you need! If your living expenses are not going to be as high as the amount estimated by your school , you have the right to turn down the loan or to request a lower loan amount. In the aid offer , your school will tell you how to do this. To determine how much loan money to accept, make a list of your college and living expenses and the resources you ll have available to pay them ; in other words, make a budget to help ensure you borrow only what you need. Remember: If you don t accept the full amount of the loan you re eligible for , you can increase the amount later. 
Informing Your School About Aid You ll Accept 
Your student aid offer will include directions on accepting aid. Follow those directions carefully. You might have to enter the amounts you re accepting in an online form and then submit the form. If you receive a paper aid offer , you might have to sign it and mail it back to the school. Accepting a loan or grant listed in the aid offer may involve additional steps, which vary depending on the type of loan or grant you re receiving. Saying yes may be as simple as signing a promissory note a contract between you and the lender * that specifies the terms and conditions of the loan or it may include entrance counseling if this is your first federal loan. By signing the promissory note , you are promising to repay your student loan. The financial aid office will guide you through the paperwork or direct you to the online Master Promissory Note if appropriate. * If you take out a loan from the Direct Loan Program , the U.S. Department of Education will be your lender.

title : Loans | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Federal student loans for college or career school are an investment in your future. 
You must repay your loan, so be sure you understand your options and responsibilities. If you apply for financial aid , you may be offered loans as part of your school s financial aid offer. A loan is money you borrow and must pay back with interest. If you decide to take out a loan , make sure you understand who is making the loan and the terms and conditions of the loan. Student loans can come from the federal government, from private sources such as a bank or financial institution, or from other organizations. Loans made by the federal government, called federal student loans, usually have more benefits than loans from banks or other private sources. Learn more about the differences between federal and private student loans. 
What types of federal student loans are available? 
The U.S. Department of Education s federal student loan program is the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program. Under this program , the U.S. Department of Education is your lender. There are four types of Direct Loans available : Direct Subsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of higher education at a college or career school. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students , but eligibility is not based on financial need. Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need , but a credit check is required. Borrowers who have an adverse credit history must meet additional requirements to qualify. Direct Consolidation Loans allow you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a single loan servicer. Try This Resource Federal Student Loan Programs Lists federal student loan programs with loan details and award limits. 
How much money can I borrow in federal student loans? 
It depends on whether you re an undergraduate student, a graduate or professional student, or a parent. If you are an undergraduate student , the maximum amount you can borrow each year in Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans ranges from $5,500 to $12,500 per year, depending on what year you are in school and your dependency status. If you are a graduate or professional student , you can borrow up to $20,500 each year in Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Direct PLUS Loans can also be used for the remainder of your college costs, as determined by your school, not covered by other financial aid. If you are a parent of a dependent undergraduate student , you can receive a Direct PLUS Loan for the remainder of your child s college costs, as determined by his or her school, not covered by other financial aid. Remember , you can borrow less than your school offers and can request more loan funds later if you need to. You should borrow only what you need. 
Why should I take out federal student loans? 
Federal student loans are an investment in your future. You should not be afraid to take out federal student loans , but you should be smart about it. Federal student loans offer many benefits compared to other options you may consider when paying for college : The interest rate on federal student loans is fixed and usually lower than that on private loans and much lower than that on a credit card! You don t need a credit check or a cosigner to get most federal student loans. You don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans until after you leave college or drop below half - time. If you demonstrate financial need , the government pays the interest on some loan types while you are in school and during some periods after school. Federal student loans offer flexible repayment plans and options to postpone your loan payments if you re having trouble making payments. If you work in certain jobs , you may be eligible to have a portion of your federal student loans forgiven if you meet certain conditions. 
What should I consider when taking out federal student loans? 
Before you take out a loan , it s important to understand that a loan is a legal obligation that makes you responsible for repaying the amount you borrow with interest. Even though you don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans right away , you shouldn t wait to understand your responsibilities as a borrower. Get the scoop: Watch this video about responsible borrowing or browse the tips below it. Be a responsible borrower. Keep track of how much you re borrowing. Think about how the amount of your loans will affect your future finances, and how much you can afford to repay. Your student loan payments should be only a small percentage of your salary after you graduate , so it s important not to borrow more than you need for your school - related expenses. Research starting salaries in your field. Ask your school for starting salaries of recent graduates in your field of study to get an idea of how much you are likely to earn after you graduate. You can also use the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook or career search tool to research careers and salaries. Understand the terms of your loan and keep copies of your loan documents. When you sign your promissory note , you are agreeing to repay the loan according to the terms of the note even if you don t complete your education, can t get a job after you complete the program, or you didn t like the education you received. Make payments on time. You are required to make payments on time even if you don t receive a bill, repayment notice, or a reminder. You must pay the full amount required by your repayment plan, as partial payments do not fulfill your obligation to repay your student loan on time. Keep in touch with your loan servicer. Notify your loan servicer when you graduate ; withdraw from school ; drop below half - time status ; transfer to another school; or change your name, address, or Social Security number. You also should contact your servicer if you re having trouble making your scheduled loan payments. Your servicer has several options available to help you keep your loan in good standing. 
How do I get a federal student loan? 
To apply for a federal student loan , you must first complete and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. Based on the results of your FAFSA form , your college or career school will send you a financial aid offer, which may include federal student loans. Your school will tell you how to accept all or a part of the loan. Before you receive your loan funds , you will be required to complete entrance counseling , a tool to ensure you understand your obligation to repay the loan ; and sign a Master Promissory Note, agreeing to the terms of the loan. Contact the financial aid office at the school you are planning to attend for details regarding the process at your school. 
Is the U.S. Department of Education responsible for Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program loans? 
Yes. On July 1 , 2014 , the HEAL Program was transferred from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS to the U.S. Department of Education ED. However , it is no longer possible to obtain a new HEAL Program loan. The making of new HEAL Program loans was discontinued on Sept. 30 , 1998. Borrowers who have HEAL Program loans and members of the community may obtain more information as outlined below. If you have HEAL Program loans and are not in default on those loans , contact your loan servicer for help with account - related questions.

title : Perkins Loan Cancellation and Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
You may be eligible to have all or a portion of your Federal Perkins Loan canceled (based on your employment or volunteer service) or discharged (under certain conditions). 
Learn more to see whether you are eligible and how to apply. Federal Perkins Loan cancellation is based on eligible employment or eligible volunteer service and the length of time that you were in such a position. Discharge of your Perkins Loan may occur under certain circumstances. 
Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation 

What are the eligibility requirements? 
You qualify for cancellation of up to 100 percent of a Federal Perkins Loan if you have served full - time in a public or nonprofit elementary or secondary school system as a teacher in a school serving students from low - income families ; special education teacher , including teachers of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities ; or teacher in the fields of mathematics, science, foreign languages, or bilingual education, or in any other field of expertise determined by a state education agency to have a shortage of qualified teachers in that state. Eligibility for teacher cancellation is based on the duties presented in an official position description, not on the position title. To receive a cancellation , you must be directly employed by the school system. There is no provision for canceling Federal Perkins Loans for teaching in postsecondary schools. Note that you also qualify for deferment while you re performing teaching service that qualifies for cancellation. Contact your college or your college s Perkins Loan servicer for information on applying for deferment. 
Who is considered a teacher? 
A teacher is someone including for example, a school librarian or guidance counselor who provides elementary or secondary school students with direct services directly related to classroom teaching. You do not need to be certified or licensed to receive cancellation benefits. However , your employing school must consider you to be a full - time professional for the purposes of salary, tenure, retirement benefits, etc. If you are a supervisor, administrator, researcher, or curriculum specialist , you are not considered a teacher unless you primarily provide direct and personal educational services to students. 
How long must I teach? 
For each full academic year or its equivalent of full - time teaching service , you are eligible to have a portion of your loan canceled. There is no requirement that you must teach a given number of hours a day to qualify as a full - time teacher ; the employing school is responsible for making that decision. An academic year or its equivalent for cancellation purposes is defined as one complete school year or two half - years that are from different school years. The two half - years must be complete and consecutive, excluding summer sessions, and must generally fall within a 12-month period. 
Teaching Part-time at Multiple Schools 
You can have your loan canceled if you are simultaneously teaching part - time in two or more schools if an official at one of the schools where you taught certifies that you taught full - time for a full academic year. 
Teaching at a Private School 
Your loan can be canceled for services performed in a private school if the private school has established its nonprofit status with the Internal Revenue Service, and if the school is providing elementary and/or secondary education according to state law. 
Teaching at a Preschool or Prekindergarten Program 
Your loan can be canceled only if the state considers such a program to be a part of its elementary education program. A low - income - school - directory designation that includes prekindergarten or kindergarten does not suffice for a state determination of program eligibility. 
Teaching at Low-income Schools 
A cancellation based on teaching in a school serving students from low - income families will be granted only if you taught in an eligible school as determined by the state education agency. To be considered a low - income school , the school must be in a school district that qualified for federal Title I funds in the year for which the cancellation is sought. Also , more than 30 percent of the school s enrollment must be made up of children in the Title I program. Each year , the U.S. Department of Education ED publishes a list of low - income elementary and secondary schools. To find out if a school is classified as a low - income school, check our online database for the year you have been employed as a teacher. Questions about the inclusion or omission of a particular school must be directed to the state education agency contact in the state where the school is located and not to ED. All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education BIE or operated on Indian reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with BIE qualify as schools serving low - income students. NOTE: If you have had a portion of your loan canceled for teaching at a low - income elementary or secondary school in one year , you can continue to have portions of your loan canceled for teaching at that school even if it is not listed as a low - income school in later years. Under certain circumstances , the institution that holds your Perkins Loan may permit retroactive cancellation if you can demonstrate that you qualified for cancellation in a prior year. However , the institution may not refund payments made during such a retroactive period. 
Teaching at an Educational Service Agency 
If you teach at an educational service agency , your teaching service may qualify for cancellation if the period of qualifying service includes Aug. 14 , 2008, or begins on or after that date. 
Teaching Special Education 
You must have an official at the public or other nonprofit elementary or secondary school certify that you are a full - time special education teacher of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities either on the deferment / cancellation form or on an official letter from the school bearing the school's seal or letterhead. If you provide one of the services listed below , you qualify as a teacher only if you are licensed, certified, or registered by the appropriate state education agency for that area in which you are providing related special educational services, and the services you provide are part of the educational curriculum for handicapped children. The services are speech and language pathology and audiology , physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychological and counseling services , and recreational therapy. 
Teaching in a Designated Subject Shortage Area 
This cancellation is based on full - time teaching if there is a shortage of teachers in your subject area. Each year the state education agency determines any subject shortage areas in the elementary and secondary schools within the state. Check with your local school system or state education agency to find out if your subject - matter area has been so designated. If you teach full - time in science, mathematics, foreign language, or bilingual education, you qualify for cancellation even if the state has not designated one of these subject areas as a shortage area. For a borrower to be considered as teaching in a field of expertise , the majority of classes taught must be in that field of expertise. 
Nationwide Listing of Teacher Shortage Areas 
You may download the list of teacher shortage areas : PDF : Teacher Shortage Areas Nationwide Listing Word file : Teacher Shortage Areas Nationwide Listing 
What amount can be canceled for teaching service?

Other Employment or Volunteer Service That Qualifies for Perkins Loan Cancellation 
In addition to teaching , the following employment or service may qualify you for a full or partial Perkins Loan cancellation depending on the type of loan you have and the date of the loan : Early childhood education provider Employee at a child or family services agency Faculty member at a tribal college or university Firefighter Law enforcement officer Librarian with master s degree at Title I school Military service Nurse or medical technician Professional provider of early intervention disability services Public defender Speech pathologist with master s degree at Title I school Volunteer service AmeriCorps VISTA or Peace Corps Find out how much of your loan can be canceled.

Conditions that may lead to discharge include the following : Bankruptcy Death School closure Service-connected disability (veterans) Spouse of a victim of the events of 9/11 Total and permanent disability 
Perkins Loan Cancellation and Discharge Summary Charts 

Cancellation Chart

Each amount includes the interest that accrued during each year of service. Note: As of Oct. 7 , 1998 , all Perkins Loan borrowers are eligible for all cancellation benefits regardless of when the loan was made or the terms of the borrower's promissory note. However , this benefit is not retroactive to services performed before Oct. 7 , 1998. 
Discharge Chart 
If your loan is discharged , you will be released from your obligation to repay the loan.

title : Reporting Parent Information | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Dependent students must report their parents information, as well as their own, on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. 
Find out who counts as your parent when you file your FAFSA form. If you are considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes , you will need to provide information about your legal parent on the application. A legal parent is your biological or adoptive parent, or your legal parent as determined by the state for example, if the parent is listed on your birth certificate. If you have a stepparent currently married to your legal parent , you generally also must provide information about him or her. View text-only version 
Who is my parent according to the FAFSA form? 
If you need to report parent information , here are some guidelines to help you : If your legal parents your biological and/or adoptive parents, or parents as determined by the state [e.g., a parent listed on your birth certificate] are married to each other, answer the questions about both of them, regardless of whether your parents are of the same or opposite sex. If your legal parents are not married to each other and live together , answer the questions about both of them, regardless of whether your parents are of the same or opposite sex. If your legal parent is widowed or was never married , answer the questions about that parent. 
What if my parents are divorced or separated? 
In this case , how you fill out the FAFSA form depends on whether your parents live together or not. Keep the following in mind as you read this section : For FAFSA purposes , your married parents are separated if they are considered legally separated by a state, or if they are legally married but have chosen to live separate lives, including living in separate households, as though they were not married. When two married persons live as a married couple but are separated by physical distance or have separate households , they are considered married for FAFSA purposes. 
Divorced or Separated Parents Who Do Not Live Together 
If your parents are divorced or separated and don t live together , answer the questions about the parent with whom you lived more during the past 12 months. If you lived the same amount of time with each divorced or separated parent , give answers about the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12 months or during the most recent 12 months that you actually received support from a parent. 
Divorced or Separated Parents Who Live Together 
If your divorced parents live together, you ll indicate their marital status as Unmarried and both legal parents living together , " and you will answer questions about both of them on the FAFSA form. If your separated parents live together, you ll indicate their marital status as Married or remarried " NOT Divorced or separated " , and you will answer questions about both of them on the FAFSA form. 
What if I have a stepparent? 
If you have a stepparent who is married to the legal parent whose information you re reporting , you must provide information about that stepparent as well. EXCEPTION : The FAFSA form asks about your parents education level. For these two questions , your parents are considered to be your birth parents or adoptive parents your stepparent is not your parent in these questions. Including your stepparent s information on the FAFSA form helps create an accurate picture of your family s total financial strength. 
What if my stepparent is widowed? 
If your stepparent was married to your parent but is now widowed , that stepparent doesn t count as a parent on your FAFSA form unless he or she has legally adopted you. 
What if my parents are in a same-sex marriage? 
Same - sex couples must report their marital status as married if they were legally married in a state or other jurisdiction foreign country, without regard to where they live or where the student will be going to school. The FAFSA questions use gender - neutral terminology for married parents Parent 1 father / mother / stepparent " and Parent 2 father / mother / stepparent " instead of mother " and father ". It does not matter which parent completes which set of questions. 
What if I live with someone other than my parents? 
It doesn t matter if you don t live with your parent or parents ; you still must report information about them. The following people are not your parents unless they have legally adopted you: grandparents, foster parents, legal guardians, older brothers or sisters, uncles or aunts, and widowed stepparents. 
What kind of information must my parents provide for the FAFSA form? 
For each parent , you ll report similar information to that you report for yourself: basic information about your parent s identity e.g., name, date of birth, and Social Security number if he or she has one; living situation e.g., marital status, state of residence, household size; and financial circumstances e.g., tax information, certain assets, certain untaxed income. Learn more about the types of information you and your parents will report on the FAFSA form. 
What if I'm unable to provide parent information due to special circumstances? 
In situations such as the ones below , you may be able to submit your FAFSA form without parent information despite being considered a dependent student : Your parents are incarcerated. You have left home due to an abusive family environment. You do not know where your parents are and are unable to contact them and you have not been adopted. You are older than 21 but not yet 24, are unaccompanied, and are either homeless or self - supporting and at risk of being homeless. If you are filling out the FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid app , you will be asked whether you are able to provide information about your parents. If you are not , you will have the option to indicate that you have special circumstances that make you unable to get your parents information. You will then be able to submit your application without entering data about your parents. However , it is important for you to understand the following : Although your FAFSA form will be submitted , it will not be fully processed. You will not receive an Expected Family Contribution EFC and must immediately contact the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. The financial aid staff may ask for additional information to determine whether you can be considered independent and have an EFC calculated without parent data. Gather as much written evidence of your situation as you can. Written evidence may include court or law enforcement documents; letters from a clergy member, school counselor or social worker; and/or any other relevant data that explains your special circumstance. The financial aid office s decision about your dependency status is final and cannot be appealed to the U.S. Department of Education. 
What if my parents are unwilling to provide their information on my FAFSA form? 
You can t be considered independent of your parents just because they refuse to help you with the FAFSA form. Still , we do understand that in some cases, the parents are not supporting the dependent student at all and refuse to provide their information on the student s application. If you re in that situation , here s the process for filling out the FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid app : When the FAFSA form asks you to provide information about your parents , select the I am unable to provide information about my parent option. If you are using the myStudentAid app, you will need to select the Learn more link when you get to the point in the app where it tells you that it looks like parent information is required to calculate your EFC. You will then be provided with an explanation of what s considered a special circumstance. After reading through the options , select the one that says you don t have a special circumstance but you still can t provide parent information. If you are using the myStudentAid app, you will need to select the option indicating that you d like to be considered for an unsubsidized loan. The application explains that if your parents don t support you and refuse to provide their information on the application, you may submit your FAFSA form without their information. However , you won t be able to get any federal student aid other than an unsubsidized loan and even that might not happen. The decision is up to the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. If you agree to this , you may submit your FAFSA form without parent information. Your FAFSA information will be sent to the colleges you list , but you won t get an EFC. You must immediately contact your school s financial aid office to discuss the possibility of getting an unsubsidized loan. The financial aid office may ask for a written statement from your parents, indicating that they refuse to provide their information on the FAFSA form and that they no longer support you. Forms of support include allowing you to live in their home, including you on their car or health insurance, providing a car to drive on a regular basis, and payment of your tuition or fees. The financial aid office will look at your situation and decide whether you may receive an unsubsidized loan. That decision is final and cannot be appealed to the U.S. Department of Education. If you re considering following this process, think about this first : If you submit your FAFSA form without parent information, you will not receive an EFC. Some state- or school - based aid programs look at the EFC in order to determine your eligibility for their funds ; because you won t have an EFC, you won t be considered for those aid programs. You could be giving up a chance at many sources of aid. So encourage your parents to provide their information doing so won t require them to support you in any way , it ll just help you be considered for as many sources of financial aid as possible. 
What if my parents are concerned about providing their information because of their citizenship status? 
Your parents citizenship status does not affect your eligibility for federal student aid. In fact , the FAFSA form doesn t even ask about your parents status. 
How should we report information about my noncitizen parents on my FAFSA form? 
Here are some tips for students with noncitizen parents : If your parent does not have a Social Security number SSN , you should enter all zeroes for him or her on the FAFSA form where it asks for that information. Do NOT enter a Taxpayer Identification Number in the SSN field. If your parent doesn t have an SSN , he or she won t be able to create an FSA ID which requires an SSN and therefore won t be able to sign your FAFSA form electronically either online or via the myStudentAid app. From the online form you can t print a signature page from the app , you ll need to select the option to print a signature page when you get to the end of the application. Print the page, have your parent sign it, and then mail it to the address indicated so that your FAFSA form can be processed. If your parent doesn't live in the U.S. , select " Foreign Country " from the dropdown box for the question that asks about the parents' state of legal residence. If your parents live and file taxes in a foreign country and don t file U.S. taxes , you ll have the opportunity to indicate that they have filed their taxes. Then , when the FAFSA form asks whether your parents filed a Puerto Rican or foreign tax return , you should select Yes. " Convert the amounts on the foreign tax return into U.S. dollars as directed by the FAFSA help and hints. If your parents live in one of the Freely Associated States , they should enter the Amount of Wages Earned from their Freely Associated States tax form in the field where the FAFSA form asks for adjusted gross income. If your parent doesn t file taxes at all , select Not going to file " for the question that asks whether the parent have filed taxes. Then you ll be asked for information about how much your parent earned from work, rather than being asked for information about specific items on the tax form.

document :

Payments are fixed and made for up to 10 years between 10 and 30 years for consolidation loans. This repayment plan saves you money over time because your monthly payments may be slightly higher than payments made under other plans, but you ll pay off your loan in the shortest time. For this reason , you will pay the least amount of interest over the life of your loan. When it comes time to repay your loans , you have the option to choose a repayment plan. If you don t choose a different repayment plan , your loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal education loan, will place you on the Standard Repayment Plan.

document : 
FAFSA Completion by High School and Public School District 
As the cost of college continues to increase , financial aid becomes ever more important. While many factors are involved in the decision to attend college , a strong correlation exists between FAFSA completion and college enrollment. Previously , high schools relied on self - reported surveys to estimate their FAFSA completion rate , and that data can be inaccurate. For this reason , Federal Student Aid is providing high schools with current data about their FAFSA submissions and completions so that high schools can track their progress and help to ensure that their students complete a FAFSA. A completed FAFSA allows the U.S. Department of Education to determine a potential student's eligibility for federal student aid a key factor in families' college decisions. The data included in the attached charts reflect the number of submitted and completed FAFSAs among first - time filing applicants no older than 19 at the cutoff date who will have received their high school diploma by the start of the school year to which they are applying for aid. For each high school , the number of submitted and completed applications is reported for the current application cycle 2020 - 2021 and the same time period last year for the previous application cycle 2019 - 2020. The data is displayed in spreadsheets broken down by state or territory that include the school name and city of the high school. Additional tabs within each spreadsheet now include estimates of public school district FAFSA completion rates for both cycles as well as state level maps presenting this data. Importantly , the district level data only includes applicants reporting public high schools and does not consider private schools that are geographically within a district. Below , you can select a state or territory from the drop - down menu to view its data, get more information about the data assumptions, or find answers to the most frequently asked questions. For high schools to track their progress , FSA regularly updates estimates for the first 15 months of the application cycle. Note: From October through June , data releases are weekly. For the remainder for the calendar year , data releases occur every other Friday. Data currently posted covers applications processed through June 5. Our next data release is scheduled for June 19 covering applications processed through June 12. IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT : Do you have concerns related to your high school within the data or on the FAFSA? We ve recently updated our FAQ and Data Details pages reflecting recent changes and trending questions, including why we recently changed the definition of a senior, why some schools are not listed on the FAFSA, and common errors or misconceptions when analyzing the data. IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT : Do you need help increasing your FAFSA completion numbers in your area or at your high school? Federal Student Aid recently launched the Financial Aid Toolkit to help counselors understand the basics of federal student aid, provide tips on hosting events along with sample PowerPoint presentations, provide suggested messages for social media and email outreach, and help find other training opportunities. Visit the site to learn more. New methodology counts more older seniors year over year comparison still possible!

All other files use the current assumption that applicants be no older than 19. 

title : Student Loan Deferment | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Student loan deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments. 
Find out if a deferment is the best option for your situation. With deferment , you won t have to make a payment. However , you probably won t be making any progress toward forgiveness or paying back your loan. As an alternative , consider income - driven repayment. 
Get Relief With Lower Payments on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan 
If you re having trouble repaying your loans due to circumstances that may continue for an extended period, or if you re unsure when you ll be able to afford to make your monthly loan payments again , a better option might be to consider changing to an income - driven repayment plan. Income - driven repayment plans base your monthly payments on your income and family size. In some cases , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. Income - driven plans can also provide loan forgiveness if your loan isn t paid in full after 20 or 25 years. Always contact your student loan servicer immediately if you re having trouble making your student loan payments. If you re seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF or income - driven repayment forgiveness , in most cases deferment will not allow you to make progress toward forgiveness. 
Be Aware That Interest Might Accrue During Deferment 
If you re granted a deferment , you might still be responsible for paying the interest that accrues during the deferment period. The table below shows when you are responsible for paying the interest and when you are not responsible based on loan type. When you are responsible for paying the interest on your loans during a deferment , you can either pay the interest as it accrues , or you can allow it to accrue and be capitalized added to your loan principal balance at the end of the deferment period. If you don t pay the interest on your loan and allow it to be capitalized , the total amount you repay over the life of your loan may be higher. Unpaid interest is capitalized only on Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans. Unpaid interest is never capitalized on Perkins Loans. 
Request a Deferment 
Most deferments are not automatic you need to submit a request to your student loan servicer, often on a form. Also , for most deferments , you must provide your student loan servicer with documentation to show that you meet the eligibility requirements for the deferment.
