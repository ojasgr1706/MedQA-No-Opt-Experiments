We cannot accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. Adoption In some cases , we can assign your adopted child a number before the adoption is complete , but you may want to wait. Then , you can apply for the number using your child's new name. If you want to claim your child for tax purposes while the adoption is still pending , contact the Internal Revenue Service for Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions. For more information, see Social Security Numbers For Children (Publication No. 05-10023).

You cannot get a Social Security number for the sole purpose of obtaining a driver's license. Government benefits or services : If your child does not have permission to work , the child may apply for a Social Security number only if : A federal law requires your child to provide a Social Security number to get a particular benefit or service ; or A state or local law requires you to provide your Social Security number to get general assistance benefits for which you already have qualified.

Acceptable documents include : I-551 Permanent Resident Card ; I-94 Arrival / Departure Record with unexpired foreign passport ; or I-766 Employment Authorization Document , EAD, work permit from DHS. If your child does not have a current DHS document , we can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity. An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph. We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names.

title : Benefits Planner: Retirement | Other Things to Consider | Social Security Administration#2

Other Things to Consider 
What Is The Best Age To Start Your Benefits? The answer is that there is no one " best age " for everyone and, ultimately, it is your choice. You should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances. Your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits. If you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time. at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time. The amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life. You may want to consider the following when you make that decision : If you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits. Depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits. If your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn. Reminders : After you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings. When additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit. If they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount. You can apply for just Medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later. When you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term. A man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years. A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. One out of 10 will live past age 95. How long do you expect to live? Did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s? If the answer is yes, and you have every reason to believe you will too , you may want to delay starting your benefits until full retirement age or later. If they didn't , you may choose to start receiving retirement benefits earlier. If you come from a long - lived family , you may need the extra money more in later years, particularly if you may outlive pensions or annuities with limits on how long they are paid. If you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier. If you stop working , not only will you lose your paycheck , but you may also lose valuable employer provided health insurance. Although there are exceptions , most people will not be covered by Medicare until they reach age 65. Your employer should be able to tell you if you will have retiree health benefits or if you can temporarily extend your health insurance coverage after you retire. Also , if you are married and your spouse is employed , you may be able to switch to their health insurance. 
Should I apply for Medicare? 
Remember , Medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. If you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact Social Security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for Medicare. Even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. If you need to sign up for Medicare but you do not , your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. Please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our Medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay. If you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : If you qualify for benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later. If you delay receiving your retirement benefit until your full retirement age or later , your retirement benefit will be higher. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached your full retirement age, and are eligible for a spouse s or divorced - spouse s benefit and your own retirement benefit , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If you file for one benefit , you will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you don't need your benefits immediately , you may decide to : Wait beyond full retirement age to receive delayed retirement credits. Reminder: If you are within 4 months of age 65, or older, and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. Choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them. Reminder: If you're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a Social Security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. The supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62. If your spouse or minor or disabled children will also qualify for benefits from your record , the value of their benefits, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner is your best choice. If your spouse or ex - spouse s date of birth is January 2 , 1954 or later and they become eligible to receive a higher benefit on your record while receiving retirement benefits , they can no longer delay filing for the additional benefit. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. However , when you start your retirement benefits also affects the amount your surviving spouse may receive. If you start your benefits : before full retirement age , we cannot pay your surviving spouse the full benefit amount from your record. Generally , if you were receiving reduced benefits , we base the survivors benefit on that amount. after full retirement age , your surviving spouse may receive your full benefit amount plus any accumulated delayed retirement credits. Accidents or unexpected changes in your circumstances can't be ruled out, of course , so your final decision may be based on your " best guess " about your future.

Retirement Estimator 

How the Retirement Estimator Works 
The Retirement Estimator gives estimates based on your actual Social Security earnings record. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates. Estimate Your Retirement Benefits We can t provide your actual benefit amount until you apply for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates provided because : Your earnings may increase or decrease in the future. After you start receiving benefits , they will be adjusted for cost - of - living increases. Your estimated benefits are based on current law. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2035, the combined trust fund reserves are projected to become depleted one year later than projected last year. Payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 80 cents for each dollar of scheduled benefits. Your benefit amount may be affected by military service, railroad employment or pensions earned through work on which you did not pay Social Security tax. 
Who Can Use the Retirement Estimator 
You can use the Retirement Estimator if : You have enough Social Security credits at this time to qualify for benefits and You are not : Currently receiving benefits on your own Social Security record ; Waiting for a decision about your application for benefits or Medicare ; Age 62 or older and receiving benefits on another Social Security record ; or Eligible for a Pension Based on Work Not Covered By Social Security. If you are currently receiving only Medicare benefits , you can still get an estimate. For more information go to this link for our publication Retirement Information For Medicare Beneficiaries. If you cannot use the Retirement Estimator or you want a survivors or disability benefit estimate , please use one of our other benefit Calculators.

Benefits Planner: Retirement 

Getting Benefits While Working 
You can work while you receive Social Security retirement or survivors benefits. When you do , it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future. Each year we review the records for all working Social Security recipients. If your earnings for the prior year are higher than one of the years we used to compute your retirement benefit , we will recalculate your benefit amount. We pay the increase retroactive to January the year after you earned the money. Higher benefits can be important to you later in life and increase the future benefit amounts your family and your survivors could receive. 
How Much Can I Earn And Still Get Benefits? 
If you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit , your earnings may reduce your benefit amount. (Full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954. Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If you are under full retirement age for the entire year , we deduct $1 from your benefit payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit. For 2019 , that limit is $17,640.

For information on the requirements for Divorced Spouse's Benefits , read " If You Are Divorced You can receive the spouse's benefit no matter what your age is if you are caring for their child who is also receiving benefits. 
How Much Will I Receive? 
If you qualify and apply for your own retirement benefits and for benefits as a spouse , we always pay your own benefits first. If your benefits as a spouse are higher than your own retirement benefits , you will get a combination of benefits equaling the higher spouse benefit. If you begin receiving benefits : between age 62 and your full retirement age , the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to your full retirement age. If you are under full retirement age and you continue to work while receiving benefits , your benefits may be affected by the retirement earnings test. at your full retirement age , your benefit as a spouse cannot exceed one - half of your spouse's full retirement amount. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached full retirement age , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your spouse is full retirement age and applying for spouse s benefits only , they can apply online by using the retirement application. Your spouse can also contact us to schedule an appointment.

Benefits paid to you as a spouse will not decrease your spouse s retirement benefit. In fact , the value of the benefits you may receive, added to their benefits, may help your spouse decide if taking benefits sooner may be more advantageous. 
Maximum Family Benefits 
If one of your spouse's children also qualifies for benefits , there is a limit to the amount we can pay family members. The total depends on your spouse's benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on the same record. The total varies , but generally the total amount the worker your spouse and their family members can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of the worker's full retirement benefit.

Questions about adding or removing certain kinds of dependents 
If you and your spouse are both Veterans with a combined disability rating of at least 30% , you can both receive additional disability compensation for each other and for your children. You should know: It ll take us longer to process your claim if your spouse is also a Veteran. But if you file your claim online, and we decide you re eligible for additional disability compensation for your dependent , we ll pay you back to the date you started the online claim process. You can submit a request through eBenefits asking us to stop paying additional disability compensation for a spouse or child. We ll need more time to process a request that involves a child than a request that involves a spouse , but the online process is still much faster than submitting a paper request.

This will help to make sure we don t continue paying you additional disability compensation for your former spouse and, if applicable, stepchildren after the divorce.

document : 
What is a title? 
A Certificate of Title MV-999 is the official proof of ownership for a car, truck, motorcycle, motorboat, travel or utility trailer weighing 1,000 pounds or more, or manufactured home mobile home. The title certificate is used to transfer ownership from one person to another. The title also lists any " lienholders " those from whom the owner borrowed money to purchase the vehicle or manufactured home. It is wise to keep your title certificate in a safe place. Don't keep it in the car or carry it with you. 
Which vehicles must be titled? 
New York State issues a Certificate of Title MV-999 for : most motor vehicles of model year 1973 or newer ; motorboats, model year 1987 or newer, that are 14 feet or longer ; and , manufactured homes , model year 1995 , or newer , that are 8 feet or more in width, or 40 feet or more in length, or cover at least 320 square feet when erected on site. New York State does not issue a title certificate for any motor vehicle of model year 1972 or older, travel or utility trailer that weighs less than 1,000 pounds, or limited used motorcycle including a moped. 
What's the difference between a title and a registration? 
For most owners , a title certificate proves ownership of a car, truck, motorcycle, motorboat, or manufactured home. The title is used to transfer it to another owner. A registration allows a driver to operate a motor vehicle on a public road, or a motorboat on a public waterway. Manufactured homes are not registered. A transferable registration is issued for a 1972 or older motor vehicle, or a 1986 or older motorboat. The transferable portion proves ownership, and is used to sell or give ownership to another person. The registration portion allows the vehicle to be operated on a public road, or a motorboat on a public waterway. 
How do I obtain a title? 
Most often , you automatically apply for a when you first register your motor vehicle or motorboat. Use the form Vehicle Registration / Title Application PDF [1] MV-82, available at any motor vehicle office, by request from a DMV Call Center or by download from the DMV internet site. You must pay the registration and license plate fees, any appropriate sales tax, and the fee for a title certificate $50.00. The same process is followed by a dealership that handles your registration and title application. The dealership will issue you a temporary registration. You will receive your permanent registration, and license plates if requested, when the Department of Motor Vehicles accepts your application. However , New York State title certificates are not issued over the counter. State law requires the DMV to mail a title certificate to the owner, after carefully examining and verifying the proof of ownership submitted with the application. As a result , the title application process may take several weeks to complete. If you do not receive your title certificate by mail within 90 days after you apply , contact a DMV Call Center. Your registration receipt can help verify your vehicle's plate number, make, year and vehicle identification number VIN. When you receive your title , check to see whether the information it contains about your vehicle is correct and agrees with the information on the vehicle registration document. If the title is incorrect , contact the DMV Call Center and ask about obtaining an amended title. If both the registration and title are incorrect , bring them to a motor vehicle office.

What proof of ownership will DMV accept? 
When you apply for an original title certificate , you must provide proof ownership signed over to you, proof of sales tax payment, and proof of identity. For a purchase made from a New York State registered dealer , the proof of ownership is a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin MCO or the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999, plus the dealer's Certificate of Sale MV-50. For a casual sale , that is if you made your purchase from an individual or a business that is not a registered dealership , the ownership proof is a transferred Certificate of Title. If your purchase does not qualify for a title certificate , the ownership proof is a transferable registration signed over to you. * If the listed proofs of ownership are not available , contact a DMV Call Center or a motor vehicle office before you make your purchase. Without proper proof of ownership , you will not be issued a New York State Certificate of Title , and you may not be allowed to register your vehicle. * * You may register a vehicle, but not receive a NYS Certificate of Title, if your vehicle's original title certificate that was issued outside New York State is held by a lienholder. To register , your Application for Registration / Title MV-82 must include a certified photocopy of the out - of - state title certificate in your name, or written verification from the out - of - state motor vehicle title authority that you are the vehicle owner and that the other state authority had sent the original title to the lienholder. If you own the vehicle but do not have the certified photocopy or the written verification , it may be registered if you present an out - of - state registration document issued in your name. After the lien is satisfied , you will receive the original out - of - state title certificate from the lienholder. To apply for a original NYS Certificate of Title , you must mail to the DMV Title Bureau: the notice of lien satisfaction, the original out - of - state issued title certificate, and a letter explaining your circumstances. 
What if I need a duplicate title or if my title is lost or stolen? 
A duplicate title is needed if your title certificate has been damaged, lost or stolen. You may apply online [7] or at any motor vehicle office for a duplicate title with no change of address. If you apply at an office , submit an Application For Duplicate Certificate Of Title PDF [8] MV-902, and provide proof of your identity and current address. The fee is $20.00. Your duplicate title will be processed within 72 hours after your application is accepted and will be promptly mailed to you. You also may mail your application to the DMV Title Bureau, with photocopies of your proofs of identity and address and the $20.00 fee by check or money order, payable to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. If you mail the application , please allow added time for postal delivery to the DMV. Please note: As soon as a duplicate title has been processed , the original title and any prior duplicates are no longer valid and may not be used to transfer your vehicle. 
What is a lien, and how is it recorded on my title? 
A " lien " means that someone other than the owner has a security interest in your motor vehicle, motorboat, or manufactured home. This usually is the bank or finance company that loaned you money to pay for its purchase. The lienholder is listed on the title certificate and on the DMV computer records. The lienholder or dealership will complete forms and pay a fee to have the DMV record the lien on your title. As the new owner , you probably will not be involved in filing the lien. The lender cannot charge you the recording fee. A lien recorded on an out - of - state title will automatically be printed on a New York title certificate unless your New York title application includes proof that the loan has been paid in full. If a lienholder unknown to you is listed on your title certificate , contact a DMV Call Center. 
What if a lienholder has the original out-of-state title? 
Unless the lien is satisfied , you can receive a New York registration but not a Certificate of Title. To register , obtain a certified photocopy of the title, or written verification from the other state's motor vehicle title authority that you are the owner, and a letter from the lienholder authorizing you to register the car in New York. To receive a New York State title certificate after the lien is satisfied , you must mail the out - of - state title, the proof of lien satisfaction, and a letter of explanation to the Title Bureau. 
How do I remove a lien from my NY title and get a "clear" title? 
When you have paid your loan in full , the lienholder must promptly send you a proof of lien satisfaction called a " lien release. " This is usually a Notice of Recorded Lien MV-901, marked and endorsed by the lender proving payment. It might also be a letter on the lender's stationery identifying the borrower's name, the vehicle by make, year and vehicle identification number, certifying the date of full payment and release of the security interest, and signed by an officer of the lending institution. Keep this lien release. You will need to give it to a buyer, along with your title certificate, when you transfer ownership. The DMV will accept only the signed, original release. You also may request the DMV Title Bureau to remove the lien from your New York State issued title by mailing the original lien release form or letter, the original title certificate, and a check or money order for $20 payable to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Photocopies are not accepted. If your address has changed since the title was issued , send proof of your current address examples: a photocopy of your current registration, driver license, or utility bill. A new title certificate that does not indicate the lien will be promptly processed and mailed to you. PLEASE NOTE : You are not required to obtain a clear title after the lien has been satisfied. Keep the original lien release, attach it to your title and give it to the vehicle purchaser when you transfer ownership. 
How do I transfer a title? 
You cannot transfer a title certificate to a new owner if the reverse side of the title is already signed over to you. You first must obtain a title in your own name, then transfer it to the new owner. The DMV will not accept titles with cross - outs, alterations or erasures of any kind. As seller , you must complete the " Transfer by Owner " section on the back of the title. Do not write on or mark the front. Do not fill in any information until you actually make the transfer to the new owner. If you change or correct any information, including signatures or addresses , the title will not be valid. If the title is voided , even if by error , you must obtain a duplicate title see above What If I Need A Duplicate Title or My Title Is Lost Or Stolen? before you can transfer ownership. For motor vehicles that are 10 model years old or newer , the seller must complete the odometer disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate. For vehicles older than 10 model years , odometer disclosure is not required. The Damage Disclosure Statement on the back of the NYS title certificate must be completed for all vehicles regardless of the vehicle's age. Then , in the title certificate transfer portion , clearly print the seller's name and address, the buyer's name and address, and the date of transfer. As seller , when you sign on the line for " Seller's Signature , " the vehicle will immediately belong to the new owner. The new owner cannot legally drive the vehicle before obtaining new license plates and a new registration, or transfer them from another registered vehicle. Tip: Before you complete the sale , take your license plates off the vehicle, and remove your registration sticker from the windshield. Unless you transfer the plates to another vehicle , turn them in at a DMV office as soon as possible. 
What is a motor vehicle "branding"? 
A motor vehicle branding is a written notice that a motor vehicle previously either: did not conform to its warranty; had been rebuilt following damage in excess of 75% of its retail value at the time of loss; originally entered New York State under a branded out - of - state title; had not been manufactured to U.S. standards; has been reconstructed; or is not equipped with a tamper - resistant odometer. A dealer must inform a customer, in writing, if a branded vehicle is being shown or sold. This may be a notice placed on the dealer's bill of sale or handed to the customer. The branding also may be a printed notice on the front of the title. Read the DMV publication Let the Buyer Be Aware, Buying a New or Used Car [9] C-18 for helpful information about brands on titles and what they mean. If you are considering a vehicle that has a title with any notation you do not understand , contact a DMV Call Center for information before you purchase the vehicle. 
What should I do if I'm the buyer? 
Carefully examine the current owner's Certificate of Title MV-999 you buy. Be sure the information is correct , and that the title certificate identifies the motor vehicle, motorboat, or manufactured home being sold. Compare the vehicle identification number VIN on the title with the actual VIN. A motorboat's VIN is located on its hull , and a manufactured home's VIN is stamped on its chassis. A motor vehicle's VIN is usually located on the driver's side dashboard, near the windshield : For a motor vehicle 10 years old and newer , be sure the odometer reading, your name and address as buyer, and the date are printed clearly in the spaces provided under " TRANSFER BY OWNER " on the reverse of the title. If the odometer reading is not available on the title , you must obtain a completed Odometer And Damage Disclosure Statement PDF [10] MV-103 from the seller. Sign as indicated on the appropriate place on the title certificate or on the MV-103 to acknowledge you have seen the reported mileage. For a motor vehicle 8 years old or newer , be sure the seller has completed the appropriate damage disclosure statement. This statement indicates whether or not the vehicle's new title certificate should be branded " Rebuilt Salvage. " The damage disclosure statement is printed on the reverse of title certificates issued beginning 1994. If an older version of the title is used , the seller must give you a completed Odometer And Disclosure Statement MV-103, available at any motor vehicle office. It is also available from a DMV Call Center or from the DMV Internet Office. If the seller indicates the vehicle has been damaged to the extent that the cost of repairs would be in excess of 75 percent of the retail value of the vehicle at the time of loss , the vehicle cannot be registered. It must undergo a salvage vehicle examination by DMV. After the vehicle passes the exam , the DMV will issue a branded title. PLEASE NOTE: If the vehicle is 8 model years old or newer , the DMV will NOT register your motor vehicle or issue you a new title certificate unless the seller has completed, and you have signed, the damage disclosure statement on the reverse of the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999 or attached a completed damage disclosure on an Odometer And Damage Disclosure Statement MV-103. IMPORTANT : THE DMV MUST EXAMINE EVERY VEHICLE IDENTIFIED " REBUILT SALVAGE " FOR STOLEN PARTS THE VEHICLE CAN BE REGISTERED OR TITLED. Be sure the person named on the front of the title is the person actually transferring it. Do not accept a title with anything altered, crossed - out, written - over or erased. If a lienholder is listed on the front of the title , be sure the seller gives you the original proof of lien release before you complete the purchase. Otherwise, you may become responsible for the lien , and your purchase could be repossessed for non - payment. As the new owner , you will need proof of the purchase price for sales tax purposes--have the seller fill out the appropriate NYS vehicle sales tax form, most often the " Affidavit of Sale / Statement of Transaction " DTF-802 available at any motor vehicle office, by request from a DMV Call Center or from the DMV Internet Office. Bring the completed form when you apply for registration and title. Then have the seller sign his or her name in full on the line marked " Seller's Signature. " The purchase now belongs to you.

See a list of all driver license topics [17]. Definition of Resident per Section 250 5 of the NY State Vehicle and Traffic Law : " As used in this section, the term' resident' shall mean domiciliary, that is, one who lives in this state with the intention of making it a fixed and permanent abode. It shall be presumptive evidence that a person who maintains a place of abode in this state for a period of at least ninety days is a resident of this state. " To live in a house, a home, an apartment, a room or other similar place in NY State for 90 days is considered " presumptive evidence " that you are a resident of New York State. A police officer can use this as evidence to issue a traffic ticket if you drive in New York State without a New York State driver license or vehicle registration. A judge considers the law and the evidence of your intent and decides if you are a resident of New York State. If you pay taxes or your children attend school in another state , a judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " residence. According to this law , students from other states or from other nations who attend school in NY State are usually not considered residents of NY State. DMV does not decide if you are a resident of New York State, if you must get a New York State driver license, or if you must register your vehicle in New York State.

title : Let the Buyer be Aware#3
document : 
Buying from a Dealer 
In New York State , every automotive dealer must register with the Department of Motor Vehicles DMV. A registered dealer must obey certain state and federal laws that protect your purchase of a new or used car, truck, or other motor vehicle, including one sold as " salvage. " New vehicles are also protected by manufacturer's warranty. You can search for registered Automotive Dealers by using the Find a DMV - regulated Business [1] service. When you buy a used vehicle , the dealer must certify, in writing, that it is " in condition and repair to render, under normal use, satisfactory and adequate service upon the public highway at the time of delivery. " The dealer certification covers the entire vehicle except items that would be obvious to the customer before the sale, such as torn upholstery, missing hubcaps, etc. The vehicle also must have all safety equipment and emissions controls required by state and federal laws for the vehicle's model year. 
A dealer also must: 
have the vehicle inspected before selling it to a retail customer, even if the vehicle is new. The inspection must be done within 30 days of the date of sale and before you take delivery. The dealer may charge you the inspection fee. provide service or repairs under the manufacturer's warranty if the dealer is franchised by that manufacturer. Warranty service also may be available from other dealers franchised by the manufacturer. indicate, in writing, on the bill of sale whether a vehicle sold to a retail buyer is new, used, reconstructed, rebuilt salvage, or originally not manufactured to U.S. standards see Title Branding. For motor vehicles that are 10 model years old or newer , the seller must complete the odometer disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate. For vehicles older than 10 model years , odometer disclosure is not required. The damage disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate must be completed regardless of the vehicle s age. Note : The DMV will not register or grant title to a salvaged vehicle without a completed salvage disclosure statement. In addition , the DMV must examine each vehicle branded or identified by the seller as " Rebuilt Salvage " for stolen parts before the vehicle can be registered or titled. complete and sign an odometer disclosure statement if the vehicle is 10 model years old or newer. This statement is on the Retail Certificate of Sale MV-50. The buyer also must acknowledge and sign the odometer statement. indicate on the sales contract when a passenger car had been used primarily as a police car, taxicab, driver education or rental car. If a lien is being recorded or the dealer issued number plates , the dealer MUST handle the registration for you. The dealer may charge you up to $75 for this service, plus the actual fees for the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999, registration, and license plates. As a customer courtesy , a registered dealer may submit your completed Vehicle Registration / Title Application MV-82 to the DMV. The dealer also may provide a temporary certificate of registration and, if needed, new license plates. 
Buying From a Private Seller 
One advantage of buying a vehicle from a private seller is the possibility of lower cost compared to buying from a dealer. However , there are disadvantages. A private seller does not have to follow important regulations that a dealer must obey. In addition , a private seller rarely offers a warranty. If you have a complaint about the vehicle or purchase , you are on your own to resolve the problem with the seller, or in taking legal action. You cannot file a complaint with the DMV or other consumer assistance agencies if you buy a defective vehicle in a private sale. If you buy a vehicle 8 model years old or newer , the DMV will NOT register or issue you a new title certificate unless the seller has completed, and you have signed, the damage disclosure statement on the reverse of the vehicle's Certificate of Title MV-999 or have attached a completed damage disclosure on an Odometer and Damage Disclosure Statement MV-103. This statement indicates whether or not the vehicle's new title certificate should be branded " Rebuilt Salvage " see Title Branding. An Odometer and Damage Disclosure Statement pdf [2] MV-103 is available at any motor vehicle office. For motor vehicles that are 10 model years old or newer , the seller must complete the odometer disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate. For vehicles older than 10 model years , odometer disclosure is not required. The damage disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate must be completed regardless of the vehicle s age. IMPORTANT : THE DMV MUST EXAMINE EVERY VEHICLE IDENTIFIED AS " REBUILT SALVAGE " FOR STOLEN PARTS BEFORE THE VEHICLE CAN BE REGISTERED OR TITLED. 
Title Branding 
If a vehicle has been rebuilt, originally not manufactured to U.S. standards, or reconstructed , a branding notice must be printed in capital letters on the front of the New York State title certificate. A dealer must inform a customer, in writing, if a branded vehicle is being shown or sold to a retail customer. This may be a notice placed on the dealer's bill of sale or handed to the customer. You can also find a printed notice on the front of the title certificate if a vehicle previously had been returned to the manufacturer, its agent, or dealer because it did not conform to warranty. It also will be printed on the title after a final determination of a court finding or settlement under the state's Lemon Law. This notice will read : " IMPORTANT : THIS VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER OR DEALER BECAUSE IT DID NOT CONFORM TO ITS WARRANTY. " The brands below may be printed on a New York State Certificate of Title MV-999 for 1973 and newer vehicles : 
REBUILT SALVAGE/NY 
A vehicle with this label has been rebuilt after being wrecked, destroyed or damaged in excess of 75 percent of its retail value at the time of loss, or originally had entered New York State under a branded out - of - state title. Previous branding includes Salvage, Rebuilt Salvage, Salvage Restored, Junk, Parts Only, Water Damage, or other description. The Rebuilt Salvage branding will remain on the title for as long as the vehicle exists, no matter how many improvements are made to the vehicle. 
NON-USA-STD 
A vehicle with this label was not originally manufactured in compliance with United States emissions or safety standards, or both. 
RECONSTRUCTED 
A vehicle with this label has been repaired or constructed with a glider kit, but not one manufactured in two or more stages. A glider kit includes all components of a vehicle except the power train. It is generally used to rebuild heavy trucks or tractors that have been extensively damaged. Passenger cars built from custom kits are not considered reconstructed vehicles. 
Reported Mileage 
Vehicles over 10 model years old are exempt from mileage disclosure. For all other titled vehicles , the odometer mileage reported during the vehicle's most recent transfer of ownership is printed on the front of its New York State Certificate of Title MV-999. If the odometer had passed its maximum reading at the time of sale , the description " EXCEEDS MECHANICAL LIMITS " will be printed below the reported mileage. If the actual mileage is unknown because the odometer is broken, or has been repaired or replaced , the front of the title will be printed with " NOT ACTUAL MILEAGE, WARNING ODOMETER DISCREPANCY. " 
Choosing a Vehicle 
National Motor Vehicle Title Information System NMVTIS Vehicle History For Consumers [3] at YouTube Vehicle price is not controlled by any government agency. Take time to choose a vehicle that meets your needs and budget. Before you buy a vehicle , compare prices by checking newspaper ads and visit a number of dealers and/or private sellers. Then take it for a test drive. If you are knowledgeable , examine the engine, transmission, drive axles, steering and suspension, brakes and electrical system. If you do not know what to look for , it may be wise to pay a professional automotive technician to examine the vehicle. Before you buy from a dealer , find out about dealer or manufacturer warranties, what they cover, and for how long. Ask if the dealer performs service or subcontracts to a repair shop. Be sure all agreements, guarantees and warranties are in writing. 
What to look for 
Examine the vehicle in bright daylight. Look carefully at the body for signs of collision damage or rust. Check the paint and vinyl top, sides, or trim for signs of wear or damage. Check all lights, lenses and mirrors for cracks or other damage. Look inside the vehicle for signs of wear or damage that may reduce its value, such as splits or holes in the upholstery. Make sure all seat belts are in place, and in good working condition. Look under the rugs or mats for dampness or water damage, which could mean there are body leaks. Open the trunk or rear hatch and check for leaks. Examine the spare tire, taking it out if necessary. Make sure the jack and lug wrench are there. Examine the engine compartment for signs of rusted metal around fenders, oil leaks, or excessive dirt on the engine. These can be signs of high mileage. Look at and feel rubber parts such as fan belts and radiator hoses. If they are hard, cracked or too soft , they should be replaced. Make sure the exhaust emissions control systems are intact and working. Start the vehicle when the engine is cold and listen to make sure it runs smoothly when cold. While the engine warms , check the dash gauges and all inside and outside lights. Make sure the heater, defrosters, air conditioner, windshield washer and wipers work properly. If the vehicle is properly registered , you may choose to take it for a test drive. The engine should accelerate smoothly , and the transmission should shift without hesitation, roughness or loud noises. Drive the vehicle on a straight, flat surface, and let go of the steering wheel for a moment to see if the front wheels follow a straight track without pulling to either side. When braking , there should be no unusual noise, vibration, or pulling to either side. Your test drive should include stop - and - go driving on local streets and driving at highway speeds, over a variety of surfaces and several hills. Note how well the vehicle runs and handles. Also , check to see if the engine overheats. If you are satisfied after the test drive , have the vehicle raised on a lift or jacks. Examine the condition of the brakes, tires, front and rear suspension, exhaust system and catalytic converter. Look for oil or fluid leaks underneath. 
Taking Delivery 
If you decide the vehicle is in good condition and worth the price , be sure the seller has the proper ownership and transfer documents. Ask the seller, and examine the title certificate, for information about unsatisfied liens bank loans, etc . . Carefully examine all documents before you pay for the vehicle. In a private sale , have the seller make out a bill of sale in addition to the ownership and sales tax documents. 
Proofs of Vehicle Ownership 
the proof of ownership is a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin MCO and the dealer's " Certificate of Sale " MV-50. the proof of ownership is the Certificate of Title MV-999, or a transferable registration for 1972 and older models, signed over to the dealer, and the dealer's Certificate of Sale MV-50 showing ownership transfer to you. The dealer must complete , and you must acknowledge by signing, the appropriate odometer and damage disclosure statements. the proof of ownership is the Certificate of Title MV-999, or a transferable registration for 1972 or older models, signed over to you. The seller must complete , and you must acknowledge by signing, the appropriate odometer and damage disclosure statements. Be sure the private seller completes the seller's section of the form Statement of Transaction - Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All - Terrain Vehicle ATV, Vessel Boat, or Snowmobile pdf [4] at NY State Department of Tax and Finance DTF-802, available at motor vehicle offices or at the DMV web site. This form certifies the purchase price and determines the sales tax you must pay when registering the vehicle. If the form is not filled out by the seller , you will be charged sales tax based on the vehicle's current fair market value. Before you accept the title certificate from the seller , check the front of the title for the names and addresses of lien holders. A lien indicates the current owner owes money on a loan for the vehicle. If a lien is listed on the title, ask the seller to give you the proof the lien has been paid - in most cases, it will be an official from the lender. If proof is not provided , the lien holder could repossess the vehicle from you. If you have a concern or question about the title, registration, sales tax or proof of ownership , contact the DMV Call Center or any motor vehicle office before you buy the vehicle. 
Trading In or Selling Your Vehicle 
Before you trade in or sell your old vehicle , be sure to remove the license plates and the windshield registration sticker, which shows your plate number. This will help prevent you from being charged with parking tickets that do not belong to you. Turn in the plates to a motor vehicle office unless you are transferring them to a replacement vehicle. Always turn in your plates before you cancel liability insurance or before the insurance lapses. If you do not, your registration will be suspended , and your driver license could be suspended as well. When transferring the vehicle's title certificate to a new owner , you must fill out the appropriate odometer and damage disclosure statements, and sign your name at " Seller's Signature. " Then enter the seller's information on the sales tax form Statement of Transaction - Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All - Terrain Vehicle ATV, Vessel Boat, or Snowmobile pdf [4] at NY State Department of Tax and Finance DTF-802, available at any motor vehicle office and the DMV internet site.

File a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request[1] 

What is FOIL? 
The NY State Freedom of Information Law provides access to state and local government records. See the Committee on Open Government [2] for more information. 
Do I need to use FOIL? 
Many DMV records are available using the Request for DMV Records PDF [3] MV-15. Check the MV-15 form carefully before you submit a FOIL request for DMV records. If you use the MV-15 , you will often receive records sooner than if you submitted a FOIL request. 
What DMV Records may I request under FOIL? 
You may request any DMV records under FOIL. However , certain records or parts of records can be withheld under Section 87 of the NY State Public Officers Law. When you request DMV records under FOIL , DMV will send you a letter within 5 business days after we receive your request. This letter will tell you your request was received .. In most cases , the records will be made available within 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgment letter.

Is there a fee for records I request under FOIL? 
Yes. The law authorizes us to charge a $10.00 search fee to determine if the records you requested are available. Your payment of the search fee does not guarantee that you will receive the records that you requested. We cannot refund the search fee. We will tell you if the records that you requested are available or not available. If the records are available and you want paper copies , we charge a copy fee of $1.00 for each page.

title : Eligibility for Students with Criminal Convictions | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Students with criminal convictions have limited eligibility for federal student aid. 
Make sure you understand your status, and don t assume you can t get aid. Your eligibility for federal student aid can be affected by incarceration and/or the type of conviction you have. Try This Resource Federal Student Aid Eligibility for Students Confined in Adult Correctional or Juvenile Justice Facilities Provides information for incarcerated individuals on federal student aid eligibility. 
If I m incarcerated, can I get federal student aid? 
You have limited eligibility for federal student aid. Once you re released , most eligibility limitations will be removed. In fact , you may apply for aid before you re released so your aid is processed in time for you to start school. However , if your incarceration was for a drug - related offense or if you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment for a sexual offense , your eligibility may be limited. 
If I m on probation or parole, can I get federal student aid? 
Yes ; if you are on probation or parole or living in a halfway house, you may be eligible for federal student aid. But remember , if you were convicted of a drug - related offense or if you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment for a sexual offense, your eligibility may be limited. 
Is it true that drug convictions might affect my ability to get federal student aid? 
Yes ; your eligibility might be suspended if the offense occurred while you were receiving federal student aid grants, loans, or work - study. When you complete the FAFSA form , you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer is yes , you will be provided a worksheet to help you determine whether your conviction affects your eligibility for federal student aid. If your eligibility for federal student aid has been suspended due to a drug conviction , you can regain eligibility early by successfully completing an approved drug rehabilitation program or by passing two unannounced drug tests administered by an approved drug rehabilitation program. If you regain eligibility during the award year , notify your financial aid office immediately so you can get any aid you re eligible for. If you are convicted of a drug - related offense after you submit the FAFSA form , you might lose eligibility for federal student aid , and you might be liable for returning any financial aid you received during a period of ineligibility. 
What other convictions might affect my aid? 
If you have been convicted of a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense, and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for that offense , you cannot receive a Federal Pell Grant. 

title : Understanding Delinquency and Default | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Student Loan Delinquency and Default 
Loans must be repaid. If you ve missed a payment or are having trouble making payments , immediately contact and discuss options with the organization that handles billing and other services for your loan to avoid defaulting on your loan. For the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program or the Federal Family Education Loan Program , contact your loan servicer. For the Federal Perkins Loan Program , contact the school where you received the loan for details. If you know that your Perkins Loan has been assigned to the U.S. Department of Education , contact the ECSI Federal Perkins Loan Servicer. If you don t know who your loan servicer is , call the Federal Student Aid Information Center FSAIC at 1 - 800 - 433 - 3243. LOG IN Automatic Administrative Forbearance and Temporary 0% Interest as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. In addition , interest is being temporarily set at 0% on federal student loans. This 0% interest and suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out what loans qualify, and get additional information about the 0% interest period, administrative forbearance, and other student loan flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency. 
Understanding Delinquency 
It's important to pay the amount shown on your bill and to pay by the due date. The first day after you miss a student loan payment , your loan becomes past due, or delinquent. Your loan account remains delinquent until you repay the past due amount or make other arrangements, such as deferment or forbearance, or changing repayment plans. If you are delinquent on your student loan payment for 90 days or more , your loan servicer will report the delinquency to the three major national credit bureaus. If you continue to be delinquent , your loan can risk going into default. Don t ignore your student loan payments defaulting on your loan can have serious consequences. Learn more on how to avoid default. Note : Credit bureaus may be called " consumer reporting agencies " on the promissory note you signed before receiving your loan. If you have a poor credit rating , it can be difficult for you to obtain credit cards, home or car loans , or other forms of consumer credit. Note: You may also be charged a higher interest rate than someone with a good credit rating. You also may have trouble signing up for utilities , getting homeowner's insurance, getting a cell phone plan, or getting approval to rent an apartment credit checks usually are required for renters. 
Understanding Default 
If your loan continues to be delinquent , the loan may go into default. The point when a loan is considered to be in default varies depending on the type of loan you received. For a loan made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program or the Federal Family Education Loan Program , you re considered to be in default if you don t make your scheduled student loan payments for at least 270 days. For a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program , the holder of the loan may declare the loan to be in default if you don t make your scheduled payment by the due date. Find out where to go for information about your Perkins Loan. If you defaulted on any of your federal student loans , contact the organization that notified you of the default as soon as possible so you can explain your situation fully and discuss your options. If you make repayment arrangements soon enough after your loan has gone into default , you may be able to resolve the default quickly. Learn more about getting out of default. 
Consequences of Default 
The consequences of defaulting cannot only impact your ability to borrow but can impact your finances as well. Consequences include the following : The entire unpaid balance of your loan and any interest you owe becomes immediately due this is called " acceleration ". You can no longer receive deferment or forbearance , and you lose eligibility for other benefits, such as the ability to choose a repayment plan. You lose eligibility for additional federal student aid. The default is reported to credit bureaus, damaging your credit rating and affecting your ability to buy a car or house or to get a credit card. It may take years to reestablish a good credit record. You may not be able to purchase or sell assets such as real estate. Your tax refunds and federal benefit payments may be withheld and applied toward repayment of your defaulted loan this is called Treasury offset. Your wages may be garnished. This means your employer may be required to withhold a portion of your pay and send it to your loan holder to repay your defaulted loan. Your loan holder can take you to court. You may be charged court costs, collection fees, attorney s fees, and other costs associated with the collection process. Your school may withhold your academic transcript until your defaulted student loan is satisfied. The academic transcript is the property of the school , and it is the school's decision not the U.S. Department of Education s or your loan holder s whether to release the transcript to you. If You Are Delinquent or In Default , Your Loan Servicer Can Help If you're having trouble making payments or are concerned about the status of your federal student loan , you have options available to you. Contact your loan servicer to discuss how to get back on track with payments. There are several affordable repayment options that you may be able to take advantage of to continue making loan payments even when times are tough. 
My Loan Was Mistakenly Put in Default 
If you believe your loan has been placed in default by mistake , here s what you can do to correct the error.

If you listed a school on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA You might get a tentative aid offer from a school and then find that it changes later. This could happen for a variety of reasons, such as if you indicated that you plan to live on campus when you submitted your FAFSA form but then later decided to live off campus or if you are selected for verification. Because your financial aid package is created for you and is based on the cost of attending a particular school , your aid amounts will vary from school to school. 
Figuring Out Net Price 
Follow these easy steps to figure out your net price, or net cost, for each school, and find out which school will be most affordable for you. First , find the cost of attendance for your program on the aid offer. If the school doesn t list the cost of attendance on the aid offer , ask the financial aid office for this figure. Make sure it includes amounts you will pay to the school directly such as tuition and fees as well as other costs such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation. Next , subtract the grant and scholarship amounts on your aid offer from the cost of attendance amount. Also subtract any savings you have available to put toward your school costs for the school year. The remaining amount is your net or out - of - pocket cost. Compare the net costs for the schools you are considering. The net cost is the amount you will have to pay out of your pocket, using earnings from work or loan funds that you borrow. If you have any questions or don t understand what s in your aid offer , contact the financial aid office at the school. They re there to help! For instance , it s important to understand what you re being offered e.g., which items in the offer are grants and which are loans. You also need to think about which aid to accept. Also , because your aid offer might include student loans , it s important for you to compare the amount of debt you would be taking on at the schools you are considering. If you find that you ll need to take out a larger amount in private loans at one school than at another , you should pay special attention to the terms and conditions of the private loans so you understand what your obligations would be.

Start Planning Early 
Plan how to pay for college before you start. Ask school counselors and the college financial aid office about state, college, and nonprofit grants and scholarships you can apply for. Be sure to meet application deadlines. Start saving before you get to college. Consider prepaid tuition and education savings 529 plans. 
02 

Fill Out the FAFSA Form 
Before each year of college , apply for federal grants, work - study, and loans with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA form. Your college uses your FAFSA data to determine your federal aid eligibility. Many states and colleges use FAFSA data to award their own aid. After submission , you ll receive your Student Aid Report. 
03 

Review Your Aid Offer 
Your aid offer explains the types and amounts of aid a college is offering you, and your expected costs for the year. If you ve been accepted to multiple colleges , compare the costs and aid offers. Accept the aid from the school that's best for you and inform them of other sources of aid such as scholarships you expect to receive. 
04 

Get Your Aid 
Time to go to school! Your financial aid office will apply your aid to the amount you owe your school and send you the remaining balance to spend on other college costs. One of the requirements to maintain financial aid eligibility is that you must make satisfactory academic progress. And don t forget to complete a FAFSA form each year! 
05 

Graduate and Start Repayment 
As you prepare to graduate , get ready to repay your student loans. Good news! Federal student loan borrowers have a six - month grace period before you begin making payments. Use this time to get organized and choose a repayment plan. If you start falling behind on your payments , contact your loan servicer to discuss repayment options. 

title : Finding and Applying for Scholarships | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Find and apply for as many scholarships as you can it s free money for college or career school! 
Start researching early, and meet deadlines , and you may be on your way to scholarship success. Scholarships are gifts. They don't need to be repaid. There are thousands of them, offered by schools, employers, individuals, private companies, nonprofits, communities, religious groups, and professional and social organizations. 
What kinds of scholarships are available? 
Some scholarships for college are merit - based. You earn them by meeting or exceeding certain standards set by the scholarship - giver. Merit scholarships might be awarded based on academic achievement or on a combination of academics and a special talent, trait, or interest. Other scholarships are based on financial need. Many scholarships are geared toward particular groups of people ; for instance, there are scholarships for women or graduate students. And some are available because of where you or your parent work, or because you come from a certain background for instance, there are scholarships for military families. A scholarship might cover the entire cost of your tuition , or it might be a one - time award of a few hundred dollars. Either way , it s worth applying for, because it ll help reduce the cost of your education. 
How do I find scholarships? 
You can learn about scholarships in several ways, including contacting the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend and checking information in a public library or online. But be careful. Make sure scholarship information and offers you receive are legitimate; and remember that you don't have to pay to find scholarships or other financial aid. Check out our information on how to avoid scams. Try these free sources of information about scholarships : the financial aid office at a college or career school a high school or TRIO counselor the U.S. Department of Labor s FREE scholarship search tool your state grant agency your library s reference section foundations , religious or community organizations , local businesses , or civic groups organizations including professional associations related to your field of interest ethnicity-based organizations your employer or your parents employers 
When do I apply for scholarships? 
That depends on each scholarship s deadline. Some deadlines are as early as a year before college starts , so if you re in high school now, you should be researching and applying for scholarships during the summer between your junior and senior years. But if you ve missed that window , don t give up! Look at scholarship information to see which ones you can still apply for now. 
How do I apply for scholarships? 
Each scholarship has its own requirements. The scholarship s website should give you an idea of who qualifies for the scholarship and how to apply. Make sure you read the application carefully, fill it out completely, and meet the application deadline. 
How do I get my scholarship money? 
That depends on the scholarship. The money might go directly to your college, where it will be applied to any tuition, fees, or other amounts you owe, and then any leftover funds given to you. Or it might be sent directly to you in a check. The scholarship provider should tell you what to expect when it informs you that you ve been awarded the scholarship. If not , make sure to ask. 
How does a scholarship affect my other student aid? 
A scholarship will affect your other student aid because all your student aid added together can t be more than your cost of attendance at your college or career school. So , you ll need to let your school know if you ve been awarded a scholarship so that the financial aid office can subtract that amount from your cost of attendance and from certain other aid, such as loans, that you might have been offered. Then , any amount left can be covered by other financial aid for which you re eligible. Questions? Ask your financial aid office.

We ll help you stay on the path to successful repayment of your federal student loan. Whether you are just beginning to repay your student loan s or have been in repayment for a while , sometimes you might have trouble affording your payment amount. Fortunately , there are solutions. 
Automatic Suspension of Monthly Payments as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency 
To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. This suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions?

Enrollment in an income - driven repayment plan is good for one year. Before the year is over , you need to recertify your income and family size to stay on the plan. Your federal loan servicer will notify you when it is time to recertify. If you can t afford your current income - driven payments because you ve had a drop in income , you can recertify early to have your new income taken into account right away. It s important to recertify every year! If you don t recertify on time , you ll be removed from the income - driven repayment plan and your monthly amount due will very likely increase. 
Change Your Income-Driven Repayment Plan 
If you ve had an increase in family size or a decrease in income , you can apply to have your current IDR plan recalculated. You don t have to wait until your annual recertification is due. The same is true if you want to switch from one IDR plan to another. A different repayment plan may offer different benefits depending on your situation. You can apply to switch at any time you don t have to wait until your annual recertification is due. Recertify or Change Your IDR Plan 
Get Temporary Relief 
A deferment or forbearance allows you to temporarily stop making your federal student loan payments or temporarily reduce your monthly payment amount. This may help you avoid default. Note: Interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. It s important you understand whether you would be responsible for paying the accrued interest during this period and how that would impact your federal student loan.

title : Third-party Servicer Program Reviews | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
Third-party Servicer Program Reviews 
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended HEA, allows institutions of higher education to outsource any aspect of the institution s participation in federal student aid programs, including, but not limited to, services and functions necessary for the institution to remain eligible to participate in the federal student aid programs , to determine a student s eligibility for federal student aid , to account for federal student aid funds , to deliver federal student aid to students , or to perform any other aspect of the administration of the federal student aid programs. A third - party servicer may be an individual, a state, or a private, profit or non - profit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible institution to administer, through manual or automated processing, any aspect of the institution s participation in any federal student aid programs. When contracting with an institution , a third - party servicer and/or its contractors must comply with the various Title IV requirements applicable to its servicing agreement with the school. A third - party servicer is jointly and severally liable with the institution for any violation of Title IV requirements resulting from the functions performed by the third - party servicer. The Title IV regulations authorize the U.S. Department of Education ED to provide oversight of third - party servicers. As part of its oversight duties , Federal Student Aid FSA routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that third - party servicers and the schools that they contract with meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. During program reviews , reviewers evaluate the third - party servicers and schools compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the third - party servicers and their partner schools must take to improve future administrative capabilities. After completing a program review , FSA issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each specific finding, the third party servicer s response, and ED s final determination. The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review ; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate ; notifies the third - party servicer of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate ; and closes the program review, if appropriate. The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the third - party servicer. Future FPRDs will be posted regularly. Below are the FPRDs issued to third - party servicers by ED : Commerce Bank : issued February 2016 US Bank : issued May 2017 Wells Fargo : issued June 2017 Nelnet Business Solutions, Incorporated : issued September 2017 Student Aid Administrators : issued August 2018 Educational Management Services, Incorporated : issued August 2018 Alliance Aid for Student Aid Processing : issued September 2018 Higher One / Customers Bank : issued September 2018 

title : Collections | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
If you default on your federal student loan, the loan may be placed with a collection agency, which will then contact you to obtain payment. 
If you default on your federal student loan , the entire balance of the loan principal and interest becomes immediately due. This is called acceleration. Once your loan is accelerated , you no longer have access to deferment or forbearance options or to a choice of repayment plans. In addition , if you do not make repayment arrangements with the holder of your loan the U.S. Department of Education ED, a guaranty agency, or the school that made the loan and comply with the terms of the repayment arrangement , your loan holder may place your loan with a collection agency. If your loan is placed with a collection agency , you will be responsible for costs incurred by your loan holder to get payment. These costs amount to 17.92% of your loan amount if your loan is held by ED. Other loan holders may charge a different amount. You should check with them to find out what it is. The 17.92% is payable in addition to your outstanding principal balance, interest, and fees. For example , if you owe ED $10,000 , you ll owe an additional $1,792 in collection fees once your loan goes to a collection agency, for a total of $11,792 : 17.92% = 0.1792 $10,000 x 0.1792= $1,792 $10,000 + $1,792 = $11,792 The holder of your loan can take other actions to collect as well. ED currently contracts with several collection agencies to administer many of the collection activities of our accounts. Many guaranty agencies also contract with collection agencies for the same reason. Collection agency employees are trained to comply with the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which govern collection practices by debt collectors. If your defaulted loan is placed with a private collection agency , you can expect the agency to first offer you the option of entering into a voluntary repayment agreement. If you do not agree to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement, or if you enter into a repayment agreement but don t continue making the payments you agreed to make , the collection agency will then begin the process of garnishing your wages Learn about wage garnishment. If they are unable to garnish your wages for example, because you are self - employed , they may recommend that ED refer your case to the U.S. Department of Justice for legal action. The Department of Justice may then sue you to collect on your defaulted loan. There are certain things that private collection agencies are prohibited from doing in connection with their efforts to collect on a defaulted loan. Prohibited actions include , but are not limited to , harassing or abusing any person in connection with the collection of a debt ; making false, deceptive, or misleading claims in connection with the collection of a debt; and using unfair or unreasonable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. If you believe that a private collection agency has engaged in prohibited practices , you can file a formal complaint. If your federal student loan is in default , find out what options you have for getting out of default. 
How do I know if the information on this page applies to me? 
The information on this page mostly applies to borrowers who have defaulted loans that are held by ED. There are three federal student loan programs administered by ED : the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program the Federal Perkins Loan Program All defaulted Direct Loans are held by ED. Defaulted FFEL Program loans may be held by ED or by a guaranty agency. Defaulted Federal Perkins Loans may be held by a school or by ED. ED s Default Resolution Group, at Federal Student Aid, oversees the collections process for all defaulted loans that are held by ED. Find out how to contact ED s Default Resolution Group. If you don t know who your loan holder is , you can find out by logging in to My Federal Student Aid. 
How will my outstanding debt be collected? 
If you fail to make and comply with other arrangements to repay the debt, which could include entering into a loan rehabilitation agreement , ED can use a variety of methods to collect your defaulted federal student loan. Find out more about getting out of default. The government can collect your debt by withholding money from the following sources of income : your income tax refund and other federal payments your wages 
Withholding Money From Your Tax Refund or Other Federal Payments (Treasury Offset) 
Federal law related to the collection of debts owed to the government requires ED to request that the U.S. Department of the Treasury withhold money from your federal income tax refunds, Social Security payments including Social Security disability benefits, and other federal payments to be applied toward repayment of your defaulted federal student loan. This withholding is called Treasury offset. If you have a defaulted FFEL Program loan that is held by a guaranty agency , your state tax refunds may also be withheld and applied toward repayment of your loan. You may also lose your driver's license or other state - issued licenses. Before the offset begins , a notice of intent to offset will be sent to your last - known address to inform you that the offset is scheduled to begin in 65 days. The notice may only be sent once , and offsets will continue until your debt is paid or the default status is resolved. You do have the right to request a review of your account to prevent the offset from occurring. If you are successful , then your tax refund and other federal payments will not be offset , or the amount being offset may be reduced. If you are unsuccessful , then your tax refund and other federal payments will be offset. If your Social Security disability benefits are being withheld , the withholding of those benefits will be suspended if the Social Security Administration SSA makes a determination that you are totally disabled, with medical improvement not expected. However , if the SSA later converts your disability benefits to retirement benefits , the withholding of your Social Security benefits may resume without notice. For more detailed information about Treasury offset or the review process including how to request a review , contact your loan holder. If you don t know who your loan holder is , you can find out by logging in to My Federal Student Aid. 
Withholding Money From Your Wages 
Your loan holder can order your employer to withhold up to 15 percent of your disposable pay to collect your defaulted debt without taking you to court. This withholding garnishment continues until your defaulted loan is paid in full or removed from default. With garnishment , you have the right to be sent a notice that explains ED s intention to garnish your wages in 30 days, the nature and amount of your debt, your opportunity to inspect and copy records relating to your debt, your right to object to garnishment, and your option to avoid garnishment by voluntary repayment ; be given an opportunity to enter into a written agreement under terms agreeable to ED to establish a voluntary repayment agreement ; be given an opportunity for a hearing to present and obtain a ruling on any objection you have to the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt ; any objection that garnishment of 15 percent of your disposable pay would produce an extreme financial hardship ; or any objection stating that garnishment cannot be used at this time because you ve been employed for less than 12 months after having previously been involuntarily separated from employment ; have the garnishment action withheld by filing a timely request for a hearing, until the hearing is completed and a decision issued ; not be discharged from employment, refused employment, or subjected to disciplinary action due to the garnishment, and to seek redress in federal or state court if such action occurs ; initiate any legal action against your employer if the employer discharges, refuses to hire, or takes disciplinary action against you based on the garnishment action ; and not have any information provided to your employer regarding the garnishment other than what is necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. One way to avoid garnishment of 15 percent of your disposable pay is to negotiate repayment terms acceptable to ED or the private collection agency and ensure that ED receives the first payment no later than 30 days from the date the garnishment notice was sent. Your other option to avoid garnishment is to make a request for a hearing. You should make a hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days from the date the garnishment notice was sent ; make a request for a hearing , even if you are requesting copies of documents , because requesting documents doesn t delay a garnishment order ; provide proof to support any objection made to the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt, or financial hardship; and pay any expenses you incur to obtain legal representation and to attend an in - person hearing. (All in-person hearings are held at one of the three regional offices: Atlanta, Chicago, or San Francisco. You are responsible for the cost of attending and the cost of any witnesses that attend on your behalf.) Your loan holder will arrange the hearing.

If my loan is placed with a collection agency, what other costs might I incur? 
After you default , you are liable for the costs of collecting your defaulted federal student loans. The largest of these costs are usually the costs of placing your loan with a private collection agency. They amount to 17.92% of your outstanding balance, which includes principal, interest, and fees. Before a defaulted loan is placed with a private collection agency , ED will explain what you can do to avoid both the assignment to a private collection agency and the reporting of default status to credit agencies. If you do not enter into a repayment agreement for your defaulted federal student loans , ED will refer your loans to a private collection agency. Private collection agencies earn a commission for any payments you make on loans that ED has referred for collection. When you make a payment , the payment is first applied to the collection cost we charge 17.92% of your outstanding balance due, with the remainder of the payment being applied to interest and principal on your loan. This is one reason that defaulting on your federal student loans can significantly increase the total cost of your loans. On each billing statement , ED projects an estimate of the total amount needed to satisfy the debt on the date of the statement, including collection costs. While the cost of placing your loan with a private collection agency is usually the largest collection cost you may face if you default , there may be other collection costs, such as Treasury offset processing fees and costs associated with potential civil litigation from the Department of Justice. 
How do I contact a collection agency? 
For the loans that it owns , ED currently contracts with the collection agencies that are identified below. If you ve heard from a collection agency but aren t sure how to get in touch with them , review the collection agency contact information below. If you do not know which collection agency your account may have been assigned to , you may contact ED s Default Resolution Group for the agency's address and phone number. 
How do I contact ED s Default Resolution Group? 
There are a variety of ways to contact ED s Default Resolution Group.

If you are contacted by a company asking you to pay " enrollment, " " subscription, " or " maintenance " fees to help you get out of default , you should walk away. The Default Resolution Group can help you get your loan out of default for free. Want to learn more? Read our blog post called " Don t Be Fooled: You Never Have to Pay for Student Loan Help. "

Get Temporary Relief 
Sometimes , you just need to suspend your student loan payments for a short period. If you re in a short - term financial bind , you may qualify for a deferment or a forbearance. With either of these options , you can temporarily suspend your payments. NEW : Automatic Suspension of Monthly Payments as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. This suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out what loans qualify and get additional information about this forbearance and other student loan flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency. When it comes to deferment and forbearance , however , there are two important things to consider : In most cases , interest will accrue during your period of deferment or forbearance except in the case of certain forbearances, such as the one offered as a result of the COVID-19 national emergency. This means your balance will increase and you ll pay more over the life of your loan. If you re pursuing loan forgiveness , any period of deferment or forbearance likely will not count toward your forgiveness requirements. This means you ll stop making progress toward forgiveness until you resume repayment. Consider Another Repayment Plan First Because of the impact on interest and potential loan forgiveness , it might be worth exploring another repayment plan before you consider deferment or forbearance. For example , your payments could be more affordable if you change to an income - driven repayment plan. Contact your loan servicer to find out if another repayment plan might be the best option for you. Discuss obtaining a deferment or forbearance with your loan servicer. Our goal is to keep you on the path to successful repayment of your federal student loan. We want you to avoid delinquency and default. 
Explore Student Loan Deferment and Forbearance 
If you re eligible for a deferment or forbearance , you can temporarily suspend your payments. If you choose to use a deferment or forbearance , consider paying the interest that accrues during that period, so that you can avoid some of the consequences. Here is an example of the impact of forbearance : If you have a loan balance of $30,000 and an interest rate of 6% and you are in forbearance for a year right after you enter repayment , $ 1,800 in interest will accrue on your loans. If you do not pay that interest , it will capitalize be added to your principal balance. Because interest accrues on your principal balance , capitalization will cause more interest to accrue over time than if you had paid the interest. It will also increase your monthly payment under most repayment plans. In this example , if you were on the Standard Repayment Plan , interest capitalization would increase your monthly payment by $20 per month and increase the total amount that you would pay by about $600. Learn more about the variety of deferments and forbearances available and how to request a deferment. 
Get Relief With Lower Payments on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan 
Because of the impact of deferment and forbearance on interest and loan forgiveness , it might be better to consider a different repayment plan such as an income - driven repayment plan. These plans base your monthly student loan payments on your income and family size. In some cases , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. You can also qualify for loan forgiveness on your remaining balance if your loan is not paid in full after 20 or 25 years. Be aware, however, that you may have to pay taxes on the amount forgiven , and if you were making payments of $0 per month, that could be a significant amount of money. Be sure to talk to your loan servicer about the best way to stay on track toward successful repayment of your federal student loan. 

title : Closed School Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1
document : 
If your school closes while you re enrolled or soon after you withdraw, you may be eligible for discharge of your federal student loan. 
Learn about the eligibility requirements for discharge and how you can apply. There are certain eligibility requirements to qualify for a closed school discharge ; you must apply to get a discharge. It s important for you to obtain your academic and financial aid records if your school closes since you might need those records if you plan to attend another school or want your student loans discharged. 
Discharge Criteria 
You may be eligible for a 100 percent discharge of your William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loans, Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans, or Federal Perkins Loans if you were unable to complete your program because your school closed, and if you were enrolled when your school closed ; you were on an approved leave of absence when your school closed ; or your school closed within 120 days after you withdrew. You are not eligible for discharge of your loans if your school closes and any of the following is true : Except in exceptional circumstances , you withdrew more than 120 days before the school closed. You are completing a comparable educational program at another school through a teach-out, by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school , or by any other comparable means. You completed all the coursework for the program before the school closed, even if you did not receive a diploma or certificate. 
Discharge Process 
Contact your loan servicer about the application process for getting your loan discharged. Be sure to continue to make payments on your loan while your discharge application is being processed. Find out what happens if your loan discharge is approved. Find out what happens if your loan discharge is denied. 
Automatic Closed School Discharge 
If you meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge of your loans obtained to attend a school that closed on or after Nov. 1 , 2013, and you have not enrolled at another school that participates in the federal student aid programs within three years of the date your prior school closed , you will receive an automatic closed school discharge. This discharge will be initiated by the U.S. Department of Education ED , and you will be notified by your loan servicer. Although this closed school loan discharge is granted automatically after three years have passed since your school s closure , nothing prevents you from applying for and receiving a closed school discharge as soon as your school s official closure date is confirmed by ED. If you 1) attended a school that closed less than three years ago, 2) meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge, and 3) want your loans discharged, contact your loan servicer about applying for a closed school discharge now instead of waiting for three years to receive an automatic closed school discharge. 
Q&A on Closed School Loan Discharges 

What benefits do I have by receiving a closed school loan discharge? 
By receiving a closed school loan discharge , you have no further obligation to repay the loan , you will receive reimbursement of payments made voluntarily or through forced collection , and the record of the loan and all repayment history associated with the loan, including any adverse history, will be deleted from your credit report. 
I have nonfederal loans through private lenders. Can I get those loans discharged? 
You will need to contact the private lender that made the loan to get that information. 
I received loans for several different programs of study at the same school, but I was unable to complete any of the programs or transfer credits from one program to another before the school closed. Can all the loans be discharged? 
Only loans you received for a program that you were unable to complete because of the school s closure are eligible for discharge. For example , if you initially enrolled in Program A, but decided not to continue with that program and transferred to Program B , and you were then unable to complete Program B because the school closed , only loans you received for Program B could potentially be discharged. In the example , you would not be eligible for discharge of any loans you received for Program A, because the school s closure did not prevent you from completing that program. 
I did not complete the program, but I received a diploma or certificate. Does that make me ineligible for a loan discharge? 
No. Before closing , some schools may issue a diploma or certificate to students who did not complete the program of study. If you did not complete your program of study , the fact that the school gave you a diploma or certificate does not disqualify you for discharge. 
I transferred credits from a closed school to a completely different program of study at a new school and completed the new program. Does that make me ineligible for discharge of the loans I received at the closed school? 
No. Transfer of credits from the closed school to a completely different program of study at the new school does not disqualify you for discharge. 
I attended a school that is now closed. Where can I obtain a copy of my academic transcript? 
Contact the state licensing agency in the state where the school was located to find out if the state has the records. 
My school informed me that they have arranged a teach-out with neighboring schools. What is a teach-out? 
A teach - out is a written agreement between schools that provides for the equitable treatment of students and a reasonable opportunity for students to complete their program of study if a school ceases to operate before all students have completed their program of study. 
If my school closes and I then enroll in a comparable program at another school, can I still receive a discharge of the loans I received at the closed school? 
It depends. If you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program of study at another school through a teach - out , by transferring academic credits or hours from the closed school, or by any other comparable means , you are not eligible for a closed school discharge. However , you may be eligible for discharge if you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program at another school , but you did not participate in a teach - out, transfer credits or hours from the closed school, or benefit from the training you received at the closed school by any other comparable means, and if you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge.
