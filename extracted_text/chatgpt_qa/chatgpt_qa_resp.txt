RESPIRATORY DISEASES


APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
A productive cough is a feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis (large volumes). Yellow sputum does not always indicate infection, as eosinophils in the sputum can give the same appearance, e.g. in asthma. Green sputum usually implies infection.
Haemoptysis (blood-stained sputum) varies from small streaks of blood to massive bleeding.
• Mild haemoptysis is usually caused by an acute infection, e.g. exacerbations of COPD, but it should not be attributed to this without investigation.
• Other common causes are pulmonary infarction, bronchial carcinoma and TB.
• In lobar pneumonia, the sputum is usually rusty in appearance rather
than frankly blood-stained.
• Pink, frothy sputum is seen in pulmonary oedema.
• In bronchiectasis, the blood is often mixed with purulent sputum.
• Massive haemoptyses (> 200 mL of blood in 24 hours) are usually due to bronchiectasis or TB.
Haemoptysis should always be investigated. Often, the diagnosis can be made from a CXR, but a normal CXR does not exclude disease. Bronchos- copy is only diagnostic in about 5% of patients with haemoptysis and a normal CXR.
For management of a massive haemoptysis, see Box 13.1.
Treatment of cough is the treatment of the underlying cause and often symptomatic. Anti-tussives include codeine linctus 5–10 mL 3–4 times daily or pholcodine 5 mL 3–4 times daily. There is no evidence that expec- torants work but simple linctus 5 mL 3–4 times daily is comforting.
Shortness of breath
Most people get breathless on exertion; exercise tolerance should be docu- mented. Breathlessness can be of sudden onset, e.g. in acute left ventricular failure, or more progressive, as in COPD. It may vary at different times of the day, e.g. in asthma it is usually worse in the morning.
Breathlessness on lying flat occurs in, for example, pulmonary oedema (p. 425). Breathlessness with a wheeze occurring on exposure to an allergen is seen in asthma (e.g. horse riding). It can occur many hours after exposure to an allergen (p. 520) in, for example, hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Inhalation of foreign bodies can cause choking and acute shortage of breath. Treatment is with the Heimlich manoeuvre. See Emergencies in Medicine p. 714.
Chest pain
Chest pain in respiratory disease is usually pleuritic. Pain can be due to other causes, e.g. localized pain in costochondritis. Shoulder tip pain sug- gests irritation of the diaphragmatic pleura. Retrosternal soreness occurs with tracheitis but also in other conditions, e.g. oesophagitis, when it is usually burning. Chest pain should always be differentiated from cardiac pain, which is usually a central crushing chest pain radiating to the jaw, neck and left arm (p. 431).
Respiratory investigations
These are discussed under specific diseases.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive condition predominantly caused by smoking and is the sixth commonest cause of death worldwide; its incidence is increasing. It is characterized by airflow limitation, which is not fully reversible. The lungs have an abnor- mal inflammatory response to inhaled particles or gases, resulting in airflow limitation.
Causes
Tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel and environmen- tal pollution are the major causes for COPD in the world, although only 10–20% of heavy smokers develop COPD.
Pathogenesis
Inflammation, infection, scarring, loss of elasticity and increased secre- tion of mucus (which blocks airways) all play a role. There is also an imbalance of protease and antiprotease activity (α1-antitrypsin being the major antiprotease).
Small airways are particularly affected early in the process (obstructive bronchiolitis).
If airway narrowing is combined with emphysema (loss of elastic recoil of the lung with collapse of small airways during expiration), airflow limitation is even more severe.
Microscopically, there is infiltration of the walls of bronchi and bron- chioles by acute and chronic inflammatory cells, with ulceration of epithelial layers leading to squamous metaplasia, scarring and thicken- ing of walls.
Systemic sequelae including skeletal muscle dysfunction (see below). Thus, the characteristic physiological effects include airflow limitation and abnormal alveolar gas exchange, leading to cor pulmonale (pulmonary vascular disease).
Clinical features
COPD is suspected on the basis of chronic progressive symptoms, usually with a smoking history of more than 20 pack years (1 pack year = 20 ciga- rettes per day for 1 year). It is supported by objective evidence of airflow limitation (or obstruction), usually with spirometry, which does not return to normal with treatment.
Patients are usually over the age of 35, have a risk factor and present
with one or more of exertional breathlessness, chronic cough, regular sputum production, frequent winter ‘exacerbations/bronchitis’ or wheeze.
Effort intolerance, ankle swelling and fatigue also occur.
Chest pain and haemoptysis are uncommon and an alternative diagno-
sis should be looked for.
Extrapulmonary features occur, e.g. osteoporosis, depression and
metabolic problems leading to weight loss, loss of muscle mass and weakness.
Signs
In mild COPD, signs are absent, except for a wheeze.
In more severe COPD, tachypnoea, prolonged expiration, pursed lip breathing, use of accessory muscles and intercostal in-drawing on inspi- ration are seen. Hypercapnic patients will be vasodilated with a bound- ing pulse and a coarse flapping tremor of the outstretched hands. Severe hypercapnia causes confusion and progressive drowsiness. Clubbing is not a sign of COPD and should alert the physician to the possibility of
bronchiectasis or lung cancer.
In advanced COPD, patients develop cor pulmonale.
Pulmonary hypertension/cor pulmonale
Pulmonary hypertension/cor pulmonale (p. 520) is defined as heart disease secondary to disease of the lung. It occurs in hypoxic patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension can be present for years without causing symptoms.
Cor pulmonale is enlargement of the right ventricle secondary to increased afterload due to primary lung disease in patients who have no other cause of ventricular dysfunction. Symptoms include worsening exer- tional dyspnoea, fatigue and chest pain. On examination JVP is raised and there is a right ventricular parasternal heave, a loud pulmonary compo- nent of the second heart sound, fluid retention and peripheral oedema.


QA :


1. Q: What are the major causes of COPD worldwide? (Good)
   A: The major causes of COPD worldwide are tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel, and environmental pollution.


2. Q: Is airflow limitation fully reversible in COPD? (Good)
   A: No, airflow limitation in COPD is not fully reversible.


3. Q: What are some factors that play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD? (Good)
   A: Factors such as inflammation, infection, scarring, loss of elasticity, increased mucus secretion, and an imbalance of protease and antiprotease activity contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.


4. Q: Which component of the lung is affected in COPD when airway narrowing is combined with emphysema?  (Not Good)
   A: When airway narrowing is combined with emphysema, the small airways are affected, leading to more severe airflow limitation.


5. Q: What are some clinical features that suggest the presence of COPD? (Good)
   A: Chronic progressive symptoms, smoking history of more than 20 pack years, exertional breathlessness, chronic cough, regular sputum production, frequent winter exacerbations/bronchitis, wheeze, effort intolerance, ankle swelling, and fatigue are some clinical features that suggest the presence of COPD.


6. Q: What signs can be observed in patients with severe COPD? (Good)
   A: In severe COPD, signs such as tachypnea, prolonged expiration, pursed lip breathing, use of accessory muscles, intercostal in-drawing on inspiration, vasodilation, bounding pulse, coarse flapping tremor of the outstretched hands (asterixis), and in advanced stages, cor pulmonale (enlargement of the right ventricle) can be observed.


7. Q: What is cor pulmonale? (Good)
   A: Cor pulmonale is enlargement of the right ventricle secondary to increased afterload due to primary lung disease, typically seen in patients with COPD. It is characterized by symptoms such as worsening exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), right ventricular parasternal heave, loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, fluid retention, and peripheral edema.

PASSAGE:


Diagnosis and investigations
The diagnosis of COPD is usually clinical, supported by the presence of airflow obstruction on spirometry.
Lung function tests
Spirometry shows evidence of airflow obstruction, with a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of < 80%, a reduced FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of < 70% and a reduced peak expira- tory flow rate (PEFR). In COPD reversibility is less than in asthmatic patients (usually a change in FEV1 of < 15%). Clinically significant COPD is not present if the FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio return to normal following treatment. FEV1 determines severity (Table 13.1) and can also be used to monitor the course of the disease and response to therapy. In addition, FEV1 can be used to test reversibility and is a predictor of mortality. Five-year survival is about 50% when FEV1 falls to < 1 L.
Serial home PEF measurements can be useful to exclude asthma. Reversibility to bronchodilators is also helpful in distinguishing patients who have asthma and to aid further management.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Other tests
Haemoglobin level and packed cell volume (PCV) can be elevated as a result of persistent hypoxaemia causing secondary polycythaemia. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) determine the degree of hypoxia and
hypercapnia. A baseline should always be taken for assessment of patients in acute exacerbations and will help in assessing the need for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).
Pulse oximetry measures oxyhaemoglobin concentration but remember that it does not give information about the CO2 (PaCO2 or arterial carbon dioxide tension) and hence alveolar ventilation.
CXR can be normal or show hyper-expanded lung fields with low flat- tened diaphragms and the presence of bullae.
Sputum culture is usually unnecessary.
ECG is not necessary in routine assessment of COPD but can show
advanced cor pulmonale; it is insensitive.
Alpha1-antitrypsin level and phenotype may be helpful (young non-
smokers, lower lobe emphysema, a family history of chest problems). The normal range for α1-antitrypsin is 2–4 g/L.
Management
With the exception of smoking cessation, the aims of COPD treatment are symptomatic relief and the prevention of exacerbations and complications. No existing medication has been shown to modify decline in lung function.
Smoking cessation
This is vital at any age or stage of the disease. An aggressive smoking cessation programme has been shown to reduce the age-related decline in FEV1, significantly in middle-aged smokers with mild airways obstruction, and also lead to a decrease in cardiovascular and lung cancer mortality. Smokers should be told to stop and an agreed target date set. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion is given, unless contraindicated, in addition to a support programme to improve the chances of success.  NRT aims to replace nicotine and thus reduce the craving for a cigarette.
Chewing gum 2 mg and 4 mg, transdermal patches 16-hour and 24-hour in varying doses, nasal spray 0.5 mg per spray, inhalational 10 mg inhalation cartridge, sublingual tablets 2 mg and lozenges 1, 2 and 4 mg are available. Nicotine patches should be limited to 3 months’ usage. NRT should be stopped if the patient restarts smoking. Common side-effects are localized reactions, such as skin irritation with patches, and minor sleep disturbances. Contradictions include vascular disease and allergy to the drug; NRT should not be used in pregnancy or breast feeding.
Bupropion sustained release is a weak, selective inhibitor of the neuro- nal re-uptake of dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). The exact mechanism by which it aids smoking cessation is unclear. The dose is 150 mg once a day for 1 week prior to stopping smoking and then 300 mg a day for a further 6–8 weeks, provided the patient abstains from further cigarettes. Side-effects include seizures in about 1 in 1000 patients. Avoid in patients with a previous history of seizures, or a concomitant administration of other medication that lowers the seizure threshold. Other side-effects include hypersensitivity reactions (0.1%), insomnia and dry mouth.
 Combination therapy with NRT or bupropion has so far shown no significant benefit.
Varenicline is an oral partial agonist on the α4β2 subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. A 12-week course increases the chances of stop- ping smoking four-fold; its main side-effect is nausea but severe depres- sion has been recorded.


QA : 


1. Q: How is the diagnosis of COPD typically made? (Not Good)
   A: The diagnosis of COPD is usually made based on clinical evaluation and the presence of airflow obstruction on spirometry.


2. Q: What are the lung function test findings seen in COPD? (Good)
   A: Lung function tests in COPD show evidence of airflow obstruction, including a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of < 80%, a reduced FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of < 70%, and a reduced peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).


3. Q: What is the significance of FEV1 in COPD? (Good)
   A: FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) is used to determine the severity of COPD, monitor the course of the disease, assess response to therapy, test reversibility, and predict mortality. When FEV1 falls to less than 1 L, the five-year survival rate is about 50%.
 
4. Q: What other tests can be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of COPD? (Good)
   A: Other tests that can be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of COPD include measuring hemoglobin level and packed cell volume (PCV) to evaluate for secondary polycythemia, arterial blood gases (ABGs) to determine the degree of hypoxia and hypercapnia, chest X-ray (CXR) to visualize lung abnormalities, and alpha1-antitrypsin level and phenotype testing in specific cases.


5. Q: What is the recommended approach for smoking cessation in COPD patients? (Good)
   A: Smoking cessation is vital for all COPD patients. An aggressive smoking cessation program, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion, should be implemented along with a support program to improve the chances of success.


6. Q: What are some common side effects of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)? (Good)
   A: Common side effects of NRT include localized reactions (e.g., skin irritation with patches) and minor sleep disturbances. NRT should be avoided in individuals with vascular disease, allergy to the drug, pregnancy, or breastfeeding.


7. Q: What is the recommended dosage and duration of bupropion therapy for smoking cessation? (Good)
   A: The recommended dosage of bupropion sustained release is 150 mg once a day for 1 week prior to stopping smoking, followed by 300 mg a day for a further 6-8 weeks, provided the patient abstains from further cigarettes. It should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures or concomitant administration of other seizure-lowering medications.

Drug therapy
This is used both for the short-term management of exacerbations and for the long-term relief of symptoms in patients with an FEV1 < 80% predicted.
Bronchodilator therapy
Inhaler therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, despite the fact that COPD is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction. It causes relaxa- tion of the smooth muscle and thus decreases airway resistance. Patients with mild COPD feel less breathless.
Inhaler technique. Patients should be taught a good technique for using inhalers; this should be rechecked regularly. COPD patients may have problems in effective coordination and find it hard to use simple metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). This can be improved by offering dif- ferent types of inhaler and/or a spacer.
Beta2-adrenoceptor agonists act directly on the smooth muscle, have a relatively rapid onset of action and can therefore be used for sympto- matic relief and prior to exercise. They can be used on an ‘as required’ or a ‘regular’ basis.
• Short-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists. Salbutamol is usually given by pressurized aerosol inhalation 100–200 mcg (1–2 puffs) up to 4–6 times a day. Terbutaline is prescribed at a dose of 250–500 mcg (1–2 puffs) up to 3–4 times a day.
• Long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists. These are used in more severe airway limitation (moderate and severe COPD). They include salmeterol 50–100 mcg (2–4 puffs) twice a day and formoterol 12 mcg inhaled twice a day (depending on formulation and severity).
Side-effects include fine tremor, nervous tension, tachycardia, arrhyth- mias and hypokalaemia.
Antimuscarinic agents are used for achieving greater and more pro-
longed bronchodilatation.
• Short-acting antimuscarinics. These cause bronchodilatation by
blocking the bronchoconstrictor effects of cholinergic nerves. They have a longer onset of action and a more prolonged and greater bronchodilatory effect than β2 agonists, and are associated with less toxicity. Ipratropium bromide is given by aerosol inhalation at a dose of 20–40 mcg 3–4 times a day or by nebulized solution 250– 500 mcg 3–4 times a day.
• Long-acting antimuscarinics. Inhaled tiotropium 18 mcg once daily improves the duration of bronchodilatation and the frequency of acute exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe COPD.
Side-effects include dry mouth, nausea, constipation, bladder outlet obstruction, exacerbation of acute-angle glaucoma and headache.
In mild disease short-acting β2 agonists or short-acting antimuscarinic
bronchodilators should be prescribed as required. Their effects are additive and once airflow becomes more severe a regular antimuscarinic can be added to a β agonist. Some patients prefer to use just one combined inhaler ipratropium bromide 20 mcg and salbutamol 100 mcg/metered dose 2 puffs 4 times a day.
Patients who remain symptomatic despite being treated with a combi- nation of two short-acting bronchodilators or patients who have two or more exacerbations a year should be prescribed a long-acting bronchodila- tor and an inhaled corticosteroid should be added (see below).
Objective evidence of improvement in peak flow or FEV1 may be small and the decision on whether to continue or stop therapy should be based on the patient’s reported symptoms.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids are given to patients in the community with increasing shortness of breath that interferes with daily activities. Inhaled corticoster- oids are usually reserved for stable COPD, but if already prescribed, should be continued throughout exacerbations.
Oral corticosteroids The use of corticosteroids in patients with COPD remains contentious but a subgroup of patients respond to these drugs with improvement of lung function. Therefore in symptomatic patients a trial of prednisolone of 30 mg a day for 2 weeks can be given, with spirometry measurements before and after the treatment period. If patients show a response (FEV1 increases > 15%), prednisolone should be stopped and an inhaled steroid such as beclometasone 400 mcg twice daily started. Regular oral corticosteroids are not recommended, but in advanced COPD, patients may require a maintenance dose when steroids cannot be withdrawn after an exacerbation.
Inhaled corticosteroids. An inhaled corticosteroid should be given, in addition to a bronchodilator, in patients with an FEV1 < 50% or with two or more exacerbations a year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids. In addition, a trial of high-dose inhaled cortico- steroid for 3 weeks in patients with moderate airflow obstruction can distinguish those patients who actually have a diagnosis of asthma and not COPD. There are a number of different formulations and inhalers available. The dose varies from 200 mcg to 800 mcg a day.
There are many side-effects associated with corticosteroids (see Box 15.2, p. 585). Inhaled steroids cause considerably fewer systemic side-effects, although at high doses adverse effects have been reported.

Combination therapy
Corticosteroids activate the β2 receptor gene, increasing receptor numbers and decreasing desensitization, whilst long-acting β2 agonists may amplify the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids are used in combination with β2 agonists for maintenance therapy in moderate to severe COPD, as they provide synergistic benefit for patients. They produce better control of symptoms, improved lung function and reduced exacerbation rates, with no greater risk of side-effects.
Combinations include fluticasone propionate 50–500 mcg per metered dose and salmeterol 25–50 mcg per metered dose, or budesonide 100– 400 mcg per metered dose and formoterol 6–12 mcg per metered dose. Patients usually require 1–2 puffs twice a day.
  Other combinations of treatment can be used if monotherapy does not control symptoms:
• β2 agonists and antimuscarinics
• β2 agonists and oral theophylline
• antimuscarinics and oral theophylline.
Clinical effectiveness should be judged by improvements in symptoms, activities of daily living, exercise capacity and lung function. If there is no benefit after 4 weeks, therapy should be discontinued.
Antibiotics
Oxygen therapy
Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) benefits patients with progressive COPD who are hypoxic with a PaO2 < 8 kPa (59 mmHg) and signs of cor pulmonale, such as peripheral oedema. These patients have a poor prognosis and, if left untreated, 5-year survival is < 50%.
LTOT can also be used for exercise-induced hypoxia and to relieve acute shortness of breath. Oxygen therapy should always be used in a control- led manner, as some patients’ respiratory drive depends on their degree of hypoxia (p. 483).
Continuous administration of oxygen is given at 2 L/min, maintaining oxygen saturations > 90% for more than 15 hours a day. A fall in pul- monary artery pressure was achieved if oxygen was given for > 15 hours, but substantial improvements in mortality were achieved only if oxygen was administered for 19 hours daily.
The following patients should be assessed for oxygen therapy:
those with severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 < 30% predicted) or moder-
ate airflow obstruction (30–49% predicted)
cyanotic patients, polycythaemic patients and those with peripheral
oedema, signs of right-sided heart failure, or oxygen saturations < 92%
when breathing air.
Patients fulfil the criteria for LTOT when they have:
a PaO2 < 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) when stable and breathing air; measure-
ments should be taken on two occasions at least 3 weeks apart after
appropriate bronchodilator therapy
a PaO2 7.3–8 kPa (55–59 mmHg) with polycythaemia, nocturnal hypox-
aemia, peripheral oedema or evidence of pulmonary hypertension
a carboxyhaemoglobin of < 3% (i.e. patients who have stopped smoking). Guidelines for domiciliary oxygen are shown in Box 13.2.
Patients requiring LTOT will need an oxygen concentrator and educa- tion regarding its use. They should use the oxygen for at least 15 hours per day or, if possible, 20 hours per day. Once established, they should be reviewed at least once a year by a practitioner familiar with LTOT. They should be warned about the risks of explosion and fire if they continue to smoke. Short-burst oxygen should be reserved for patients with episodes of severe breathlessness that is not relieved by other treatment.
An oxygen alert card stating the oxygen saturation should be given to all patients who have had hypercapnic respiratory failure.

   - β2 agonists and oral theophylline
   - antimuscarinics and oral theophylline


4. Q: How should the clinical effectiveness of combination therapy in COPD be assessed? (Good)
   A: Clinical effectiveness of combination therapy in COPD should be judged based on improvements in symptoms, activities of daily living, exercise capacity, and lung function. If there is no benefit observed after 4 weeks, therapy should be discontinued.


5. Q: Under what conditions is long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) beneficial for patients with COPD? (Good)
   A: Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is beneficial for patients with progressive COPD who are hypoxic, with a PaO2 < 8 kPa (59 mmHg), and signs of cor pulmonale, such as peripheral edema. LTOT can also be used for exercise-induced hypoxia and to relieve acute shortness of breath.


6. Q: What criteria should be met for a patient to be considered for LTOT? (Good)
   A: Patients should be assessed for oxygen therapy if they have severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 < 30% predicted) or moderate airflow obstruction (30-49% predicted), are cyanotic, polycythemic, have peripheral edema, signs of right-sided heart failure, or oxygen saturations < 92% when breathing air. For LTOT, the specific criteria are:
   - A PaO2 < 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) when stable and breathing air (confirmed on two occasions at least 3 weeks apart after bronchodilator therapy)
   - A PaO2 7.3-8 kPa (55-59 mmHg) with polycythemia, nocturnal hypoxemia, peripheral edema, or evidence of pulmonary hypertension
   - A carboxyhemoglobin level of < 3% (for patients who have stopped smoking)


7. Q: What are the recommended oxygen saturation levels and duration for LTOT? (Good)
   A: Continuous administration of oxygen should be given at 2 L/min, maintaining oxygen saturations > 90% for more than 15 hours a day. To achieve a substantial improvement in mortality, oxygen should be administered for at least 19 hours daily.


8. Q: How often should patients receiving LTOT be reviewed, and what precautions should they be aware of? (Good)
   A: Patients receiving LTOT should be reviewed at least once a year by a practitioner familiar with LTOT. They should be warned about the risks of explosion and fire if they continue to smoke. Short-burst oxygen should be reserved for patients with episodes of severe breathlessness that is not relieved by other treatments. An oxygen alert card stating the oxygen saturation should be given to all patients who have had hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
This is mainly used for exacerbations of COPD — see p. 485. The ventila- tors are small and can be used at home. Patients should be considered for home NIV if, despite maximal treatment, they have hypercapnic respira- tory failure and have required ventilatory support during an exacerbation, or are acidotic or hypercapnic on LTOT.

home NIV if, despite maximal treatment, they have hypercapnic respira- tory failure and have required ventilatory support during an exacerbation, or are acidotic or hypercapnic on LTOT.
Diuretic therapy (p. 420)
This is necessary for all oedematous patients. Patients should be weighed daily.
Other agents
Oral mucolytic drugs. Mucolytics increase the expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity. Regular use of mucolytics for at least 2 months can reduce the number of exacerbations of COPD and days of illness. They should be used in patients with a chronic productive cough but only continued if there is continual symptomatic improvement.
• Carbocisteine 2.25 g a day in divided doses, then 1.5 g daily in divided doses. Erdosteine 300 mg twice daily is also used.
• Mecysteine hydrochloride 200 mg 4 times a day for 2 days, followed by 200 mg 3 times a day for 6 weeks, then 200 mg twice daily.
Anti-oxidants. N-acetylcysteine has both anti-oxidant and mucolytic properties, and has been shown to reduce frequency of exacerbations. However, it and other anti-oxidants, such as α-tocopherol and β-carotene supplements, are currently not recommended.


Anti-tussives. Regular use of anti-tussive medication is not recom- mended in COPD, as there is insufficient evidence for its benefit, and although cough is a problematic symptom, it has a protective role.
Antibiotics
• There is no evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
• Give antibiotics in acute exacerbations, as they shorten exacerbations
and may prevent hospital admission.
• Give the patient a supply of antibiotics to keep at home, to start when
sputum turns yellow or green.
• Amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily is still effective, although resistance
to H. influenzae occurs in 10–20%. Resistance is less frequent to cefaclor 500 mg 8-hourly or cefixime 400 mg once daily; co-amoxiclav is an alternative.
Long-term treatment with antibiotics was thought to be of little value but eradication of infection and keeping the lower respiratory tract free of bacteria may help prevent deterioration in lung function.
Vaccination/antiviral therapy
• Polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine usually pro-
vides lifelong immunity after a single dose.
• Annual influenza vaccination should be given, unless patients have
a hypersensitivity to eggs.
• Antiviral agents include zanamivir inhalation of 10 mg twice daily
for 5 days and oseltamivir 75 mg 12-hourly for 5 days. They are recommended for the treatment of ‘at-risk’ adults who can start therapy within 48 hours of presenting with an influenza-like illness. For side-effects, see p. 91.
Antidepressants. These may be helpful in COPD, as mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression are common.
Alpha1-protease inhibitor augmentation therapy. Young patients with severe hereditary α1-antitrypsin deficiency with serum levels < 0.31 g/L and abnormal lung function are candidates for α1-antitrypsin replace- ment therapy. There is limited evidence for its benefit in modifying the disease in the long term.
Non-pharmacological interventions
Physiotherapy. Physiotherapy is helpful for patients with excessive sputum. Patients should be encouraged to cough to remove sputum and taught the active cycle of breathing techniques and how to use positive expiratory pressure masks.
Nutrition. Weight loss is common in patients with COPD and there is an association between low BMI and increased mortality. Patients with a low BMI should be referred for dietary advice and nutritional supple- ments. Overweight patients should also be offered dietary advice, as obesity puts additional strain on the cardio-respiratory system.
Pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients with moderate to severe COPD on optimal medical treatment should be put on a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. The aim is to prevent or reverse the deconditioning that occurs in patients with COPD due to lack of exercise and immobility caused by symptoms. The rehabilitation programme is provided by a multi-disciplinary team and includes physical training, disease educa- tion, nutritional advice, and psychological, social and behavioural intervention.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Surgery
Surgical treatment for COPD is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and patients must be carefully selected and be receiving optimal medical management prior to surgery. Bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation are used in severe disease.
Acute exacerbations of COPD (type II respiratory failure)
An acute exacerbation is defined as ‘a sustained worsening of the patient’s symptoms from his or her usual stable state that is beyond normal day-to- day variations, and is acute in onset’.
Exacerbations of COPD are among the commonest acute respiratory problems presenting to primary or secondary care.
They are usually caused by infection, although only 50% of patients will
have a positive sputum culture. The commonest organisms are H. influ-
enzae, Strep. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
Viruses, including rhinovirus, influenza (including H1N1 swine flu
variant), coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus,
account for up to 30% of cases.
Pollutants may also precipitate an exacerbation.
Some patients with mild exacerbations can be treated at home, but
factors such as acute confusion, a decreased level of consciousness, significant co-morbidities, severe breathlessness and acidosis require hospital admission.






QA :




1. Q: When is non-invasive ventilation (NIV) used and under what conditions should patients be considered for home NIV? (Good)
   A: NIV is mainly used for exacerbations of COPD. Patients should be considered for home NIV if, despite maximal treatment, they have hypercapnic respiratory failure and have required ventilatory support during an exacerbation, or are acidotic or hypercapnic on LTOT.


2. Q: What are the guidelines for domiciliary oxygen therapy in patients with various respiratory conditions? (Good)
   A: The guidelines for domiciliary oxygen therapy include:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with PaO2 < 7.3 kPa when breathing air during clinical stability
   - COPD with PaO2 7.3-8 kPa in the presence of secondary polycythemia, nocturnal hypoxemia, peripheral edema, or evidence of pulmonary hypertension
   - Severe chronic asthma with PaCO2 < 7.3 kPa or persistent disabling breathlessness
   - Diffuse lung disease with PaO2 < 8 kPa and in patients with PaO2 > 8 kPa with disabling dyspnea
   - Cystic fibrosis when PaO2 < 7.3 kPa or if PaO2 7.3-8 kPa in the presence of secondary polycythemia, nocturnal hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, or peripheral edema
   - Pulmonary hypertension without parenchymal lung involvement when PaO2 < 8 kPa
   - Neuromuscular or skeletal disorders, after specialist assessment
   - Obstructive sleep apnea despite continuous positive airways pressure therapy, after specialist assessment
   - Pulmonary malignancy or other terminal disease with disabling dyspnea
   - Heart failure with daytime PaO2 < 7.3 kPa (on air) or with nocturnal hypoxemia


3. Q: Why is diuretic therapy necessary for patients with edema in COPD, and what is the recommended approach? (Good)
   A: Diuretic therapy is necessary for all oedematous patients in COPD. Patients should be weighed daily to monitor fluid status and adjust diuretic dosages accordingly.


4. Q: What are the recommended non-pharmacological interventions for COPD management? (Good)
   A: The recommended non-pharmacological interventions for COPD management include:
   - Physiotherapy: Patients should be encouraged to cough to remove sputum and taught the active cycle of breathing techniques and how to use positive expiratory pressure masks.
   - Nutrition: Dietary advice and nutritional supplements should be provided to patients with low BMI or weight loss. Overweight patients should also be offered dietary advice.
   - Pulmonary rehabilitation: Patients with moderate to severe COPD on optimal medical treatment should be enrolled in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. It includes physical training, disease education, nutritional advice, and psychological, social, and behavioral intervention.


5. Q: What surgical treatments are used for severe COPD, and what are the considerations before opting for surgery? (Good)
   A: Surgical treatment options for severe COPD include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. However, surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality, so patients must be carefully selected and receiving optimal medical management prior to surgery.


6. Q: What characterizes an acute exacerbation of COPD, and what are the common causes of exacerbations? (Good)
   A: An acute exacerbation of COPD is a sustained worsening of symptoms from the patient's usual stable state that is acute in onset and beyond normal day-to-day variations. Exacerbations are usually caused by infections, with bacteria like H. influenzae, Strep. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis being common. Viruses and pollutants can also precipitate exacerbations.


7. Q: When should antibiotics be used in the management of COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: Antibiotics should be given in acute exacerbations of COPD as they shorten the exacerbations and may prevent hospital admission. Patients can be provided with a supply of antibiotics to keep at home and start when sputum turns yellow or green. Amoxicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, or co-amoxiclav are commonly used antibiotics.


8. Q: What is the role of vaccination and antiviral therapy in COPD management? (Good)
   A: Vaccination plays a crucial role in COPD management. Patients should receive the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and annual influenza vaccination unless they have hypersensitivity to eggs. Antiviral agents like zanamivir and oseltamivir can be used for the treatment of "at-risk" adults with influenza-like illness if started within 48 hours of presentation.


9. Q: Are anti-tussives recommended for COPD management, and what is their role? (Good)
   A: Regular use of anti-tussive medication is not recommended in COPD as there is insufficient evidence for its benefit. Cough, although a problematic symptom, has a protective role in COPD.


10. Q: Do oral mucolytic drugs have a role in COPD management, and how should they be used? (Good)
    A: Oral mucolytic drugs can be used in COPD management. Drugs like carbocisteine, erdosteine, and mecysteine hydrochloride can reduce the number of exacerbations and days of illness when used regularly for at least 2 months. They should be used in patients with a chronic productive cough and continued only if there is continual symptomatic improvement.


11. Q: What is the role of antidepressants and alpha1-protease inhibitor augmentation therapy in COPD management? (Not Good)
    A: Antidepressants may be helpful in COPD as mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression are common. Alpha1-protease inhibitor augmentation therapy may be beneficial in young patients with severe hereditary α1-antitrypsin deficiency and abnormal lung function, but the evidence for long-term benefit is limited.

Investigations l CXR for signs of infection or other pathologies, e.g. pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema. l Baseline ABGs on room air (or a known inspired oxygen concentration) to look for hypoxia or hypercapnia. l Purulent sputum for culture. l ECG to look for a cardiac cause for the deterioration. l Blood cultures if the patient is pyrexial. l Routine bloods for FBC and U&E. Treatment The treatment of respiratory failure in COPD is shown in Fig. 13.1. General care includes prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, optimizing fluid status and ensuring adequate nutrition. l Controlled oxygen. A fixed performance mask can deliver 24%, 28% and 35% oxygen. It is given to correct hypoxia and maintain oxygen saturations > 90%. In a minority of patients respiratory drive is hypoxic and high oxygen concentrations can result in increasing levels of carbon dioxide, decreasing consciousness, and respiratory acidosis and arrest. Pulse oximetry should always be available to measure oxygen saturations. An ABG is performed on arrival in hospital to monitor CO2 levels. Oxygen concentrations should never be reduced in patients who are hypoxic, even if CO2 levels are high. l Bronchodilators (p. 478). There is no benefit in delivering bronchodilators via a nebulizer over an inhaler in acute exacerbations of COPD. Bronchodilators are, however, given via a nebulizer with a face mask or mouth piece delivering higher doses if patients are too breathless to coordinate the use of an inhaler/spacer. If the patient is hypercapnic, the nebulizer should be driven with air and not oxygen. Oxygen can be given at the same time via nasal cannulae. Respiratory disease Inhaled β2 short-acting adrenergic agonists (p. 478). The frequency and dose of inhaled β2-agonists can be increased in an acute exacerbation. They reach peak activity between 10 and 30 mins, and remain effective for about 4–6 hours. Salbutamol (via inhaler or nebulizer) is the most commonly used. Nebulizers are given at a dose of 2.5–5 mg, usually 4 times daily, although this can be increased provided sideeffects are tolerated. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of IV β2-agonists in acute exacerbations of COPD. l Inhaled short-acting antimuscarinics. These agents are often used in combination with inhaled β2-agonists in acute exacerbations of COPD and are associated with fewer side-effects. They have a less rapid onset of action but a longer duration of action. They can be delivered via an inhaler as ipratropium bromide 20–40 mcg, or via a nebulizer ipratropium bromide 500 mcg, salbutamol 2.5 mg/2.5 mL vial, 1 vial 4 times a day. l Systemic corticosteroids. These drugs reduce the increased airway inflammation in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Short courses of corticosteroids have been shown to reduce FEV1, improve hypoxia and shorten duration of hospital stay compared to placebo. All patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation should receive a course of oral corticosteroids 30 mg for 7–14 days, in addition to other therapies, provided there are no contraindications. The first dose of corticosteroids can be given intravenously as hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone. If patients do receive a prolonged course of corticosteroids, the dose should be gradually tapered down. l Antibiotics (p. 482). There is some evidence for a small but significant benefit with antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD, especially in those with more severe disease. The use of antibiotics is recommended in patients with a history of increased purulence or production of sputum or in those with consolidation on CXR or clinical signs of pneumonia. Initially, treatment is empirical, with an aminopenicillin, a macrolide or a tetracycline, and then changed when culture results and sensitivities become available. Antibiotic use should be guided by local policy. Commonly used antibiotics include amoxicillin 250–500 mg 3 times daily (15% of Haemophilus strains may be resistant), doxycycline 200 mg then 100 mg daily, or erythromycin 250–500 mg every 6 hours or 0.5–1 g every 12 hours. Ampicillin can be used instead of amoxicillin. l Methylxanthines. The use of methylxanthines such as theophylline (p. 501) remains controversial, as there is currently no clear evidence of benefit in acute exacerbations of COPD. IV theophylline should only be used in patients refractory to nebulized bronchodilators, and levels should be monitored within 24 hours of treatment and regularly after this period. Patients already taking oral methylxanthines should continue on this medication during an exacerbation and should not receive additional IV methylxanthines. IV methylxanthines are usually prescribed as aminophylline loading dose 5 mg/kg (250–500 mg) over at least 20 mins, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hour over 24 hours adjusted according to plasma levels. Patients should be closely monitored throughout. l Respiratory stimulants. These (e.g. Doxapram 1.5–4.0 mg/min) are only recommended for use when NIV is unavailable or considered inappropriate.


QA : 


1. Q: What investigations are typically performed in the management of respiratory failure in COPD? (Good)
   A: Common investigations include:
   - CXR for signs of infection or other pathologies
   - Baseline ABGs on room air to assess hypoxia or hypercapnia
   - Purulent sputum culture
   - ECG to identify cardiac causes for deterioration
   - Blood cultures if the patient is pyrexial
   - Routine blood tests for FBC and U&E.


2. Q: What is the goal of controlled oxygen therapy in COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: The goal of controlled oxygen therapy is to correct hypoxia and maintain oxygen saturations above 90%. However, caution should be exercised to avoid excessive oxygen administration that can lead to worsening respiratory acidosis and arrest in patients with hypoxic respiratory drive.


3. Q: How are bronchodilators administered in acute exacerbations of COPD? (Good)
   A: Bronchodilators can be administered via an inhaler or nebulizer. In acute exacerbations, a nebulizer with a face mask or mouthpiece may be used if the patient is too breathless to coordinate inhaler use.


4. Q: What is the recommended dose and frequency of inhaled β2-agonists in acute exacerbations of COPD? (Good)
   A: Inhaled β2-agonists, such as salbutamol, can be increased in frequency during an acute exacerbation. Nebulizers are typically given at a dose of 2.5-5 mg, usually four times daily.


5. Q: How do systemic corticosteroids benefit patients with acute exacerbations of COPD? (Good)
   A: Systemic corticosteroids help reduce airway inflammation in acute exacerbations of COPD. They have been shown to improve hypoxia, reduce FEV1, and shorten hospital stay. A short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., 30 mg for 7-14 days) is recommended.


6. Q: When should antibiotics be used in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD? (Good)
   A: Antibiotics should be used in acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of increased purulence or sputum production, consolidation on CXR, or clinical signs of pneumonia. Empirical treatment with antibiotics is initially started, and the choice is guided by local policy and adjusted based on culture results and sensitivities.


7. Q: Are methylxanthines recommended for acute exacerbations of COPD? (Good)
   A: The use of methylxanthines, such as theophylline, in acute exacerbations of COPD is controversial. There is currently no clear evidence of benefit. IV theophylline may be considered in patients refractory to nebulized bronchodilators, with close monitoring of plasma levels.


8. Q: When are respiratory stimulants, such as doxapram, recommended in COPD management? (Good)
   A: Respiratory stimulants are only recommended when non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is unavailable or considered inappropriate.


Note: It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options for specific medical conditions.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
This is the treatment of choice in patients with exacerbations of COPD
who, despite maximal medical therapy and controlled oxygen therapy,
have a persistent respiratory acidosis (pH 7.25–7.35, [H+] 45–56 nmol/L).
A tight-fitting facial mask delivers bi-level positive airway pressure
ventilatory support (BiPAP). Continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP, p. 542) is also used. NIV can avoid the need for endotracheal
intubation.
l Patients with pH < 7.25 respond less well to NIV and should be referred
directly for tracheal intubation or a trial of NIV in an intensive care
setting.
l NIV results in a reduced need for endotracheal intubation and thus the
associated complications. There is improved acidaemia, a reduction in
mortality and a shortening of hospital stay. NIV allows better communication, and nutrition and physiotherapy to continue as normal.
l Contraindications to NIV include impaired consciousness, recent facial
or upper airway surgery, facial abnormalities such as burns or trauma,
undrained pneumothorax, hypoxaemia, cardiovascular instability, inability to protect the airway, recent gastrointestinal surgery, vomiting
and copious respiratory secretions.
l Endotracheal intubation
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are used in patients
with acidaemia or with persistent or worsening hypoxia despite NIV, and
when NIV is contraindicated.
l Mortality in patients with COPD who are intubated for an exacerbation
is about 20%.
l Assessment for suitability for intubation and ventilation includes functional status, requirement for oxygen when stable, BMI, co-morbidities,
previous admissions to the ICU, FEV1 and age. Weaning from a ventilator can be difficult and NIV can be used post extubation to shorten
weaning time.
l Other therapies
Although there is no proven benefit, chest physiotherapy, particularly with
the use of positive expiratory pressure masks, can be helpful in patients
with copious secretions. Currently, there is no evidence showing benefit
for the use of heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) in patients with exacerbations of COPD.
Prognosis of COPD
The predictors of a poor prognosis are increasing age and worsening
airflow limitation, i.e. a fall in FEV1. A predictive index (BODE = body
mass index, degree of airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity)
has recently been modified, improving prediction of outcome, and is
shown in Table 13.2. A patient with a BODE index of 0–2 has a mortality
rate of 10% and with 7–10 it rises to 80% at 4 years. A simpler index using
age, dyspnoea and airflow obstruction (ADO) gives a similar prognosis.
Discharge planning
l Prior to discharge patients should have adequate and stable gas
exchange (oxygen saturations and ABGs) on optimal maintenance bronchodilator therapy.
l They should understand what medication to take, including oxygen
therapy if required.
l Spirometry should be measured prior to discharge as a baseline for
further measurements.
l A follow-up appointment should be made for 4–6 weeks, especially
for those with respiratory failure who may require assessment for
LTOT.
l Ensure that there is adequate support at home.




QA : 




1. Q: What is the treatment of choice in patients with exacerbations of COPD who have persistent respiratory acidosis despite maximal medical therapy and controlled oxygen therapy? (Good)
   A: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the treatment of choice in such patients. It involves the use of a tight-fitting facial mask to deliver bi-level positive airway pressure ventilatory support (BiPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).


2. Q: What are the benefits of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the management of COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: NIV can help avoid the need for endotracheal intubation. It leads to a reduced need for intubation, improved acidaemia, reduced mortality, and shorter hospital stay. NIV also allows for better communication, as well as the continuation of nutrition and physiotherapy.


3. Q: What are the contraindications to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: Contraindications to NIV include impaired consciousness, recent facial or upper airway surgery, facial abnormalities (e.g., burns or trauma), undrained pneumothorax, hypoxemia, cardiovascular instability, inability to protect the airway, recent gastrointestinal surgery, vomiting, and copious respiratory secretions.


4. Q: When is endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation used in COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are used in patients with acidaemia or persistent/worsening hypoxia despite NIV, as well as when NIV is contraindicated.


5. Q: What is the mortality rate for COPD patients who require endotracheal intubation during an exacerbation? (Good)
   A: The mortality rate for COPD patients who are intubated for an exacerbation is approximately 20%.


6. Q: What factors are assessed to determine suitability for intubation and ventilation in COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: Factors such as functional status, oxygen requirement when stable, BMI, co-morbidities, previous ICU admissions, FEV1, and age are assessed to determine suitability for intubation and ventilation. NIV can be used post-extubation to aid in weaning from the ventilator.


7. Q: Are chest physiotherapy and the use of heliox beneficial in COPD exacerbations? (Good)
   A: Chest physiotherapy, particularly with positive expiratory pressure masks, may be helpful in patients with copious secretions, although there is no proven benefit. Currently, there is no evidence showing benefit for the use of heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) in patients with COPD exacerbations.


8. Q: What are some considerations for discharge planning in COPD patients? (Good)
   A: Considerations for discharge planning include ensuring adequate and stable gas exchange (oxygen saturations and ABGs) on optimal maintenance bronchodilator therapy, ensuring understanding of medication instructions (including oxygen therapy if required), measuring spirometry as a baseline for future assessments, scheduling a follow-up appointment for 4-6 weeks, especially for those with respiratory failure who may require assessment for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), and ensuring there is adequate support at home.

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA/ HYPOPNOEA SYNDROME l Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) affects 1–2% of the population and is commonly seen in overweight, middleaged men. l It is a syndrome caused by abnormal size and/or collapsibility of the pharynx during sleep, which disrupts sleep and causes symptoms. l During sleep, activity of the respiratory muscles is reduced and in OSAHS this results in collapse of the upper airways intermittently and repeatedly. If there is complete collapse, there is total obstruction of the airway and no respiratory flow (apnoea); partial collapse may cause snoring; and if there is critical collapse, there is reduced flow (hypopnoea). l Apnoea results in hypoxia and increasingly strenuous respiratory efforts until the patient overcomes the resistance and there is termination of the apnoea and resumption of breathing. l The patient wakes up as a result of the combination of this increased respiratory effort and central hypoxic stimulation. Patients may wake up hundreds of times per night, resulting in reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and sleep deprivation. Patients are usually unaware of these night-time awakenings. Factors predisposing to OSAH include increasing age, male gender, obesity, sedative drugs, smoking and alcohol consumption. l Differential diagnosis. Central sleep apnoea is due to impairment of central ventilatory control secondary to brainstem pathology. It occurs at the onset of sleep and is seen in non-obese patients with no history of snoring. Diagnosis Symptoms These include excessive daytime somnolence (90%), impaired concentration and loud snoring (95%). Patients may fall asleep at work, whilst driving or in mid-conversation. If patients present with typical symptoms, they should be asked to complete an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The maximum score is 24, normal range is < 11, mild daytime sleepiness 11–14, moderate subjective daytime sleepiness 15–18 and severe daytime sleepiness > 18. Patients and their partners should fill out the Epworth Sleepiness Scale independently, as patients often under-estimate the severity of their symptoms because onset is often gradual and there may be concerns over driving. Examination Examination includes a recording of weight, height, neck circumference and BP. Mandible size should be noted. There should be a full examination of the nose, oral cavity and upper airways, and a complete respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological assessment. Complications OSAHS has been associated with hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes and lipid abnormalities, and there is increasing evidence of an association with increased cerebrovascular events. Patients with OSAHS may decompensate with hypercapnic respiratory failure or cor pulmonale, especially if there is co-existent COPD. Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome Referrals Patients with an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale; those with symptoms suggestive of OSAHS with sleepiness in dangerous situations, such as driving or operating hazardous equipment, even if the ESS is normal; and those with likely OSAHS and COPD should be referred to a specialist sleep centre. Investigations Sleep studies The primary aims of sleep studies are to assess sleep fragmentation, to establish whether a respiratory problem is responsible and to decide if upper airway obstruction is the primary cause. l Oximetry is cheap and widely available. It can be used to measure the number of oxygen desaturations per hour or the time spent below an agreed SpO2 level during the study. Oximetry has a role in initial assessment but limited sleep studies or polysomnography are usually required for diagnosis of OSAHS. l Polysomnography records sleep and breathing patterns simultaneously. Full polysomnography monitors sleep stage, oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, airflow, thoraco-abdominal movement, snoring, ECG, body position and limb movements. This is an expensive technique, as the patient needs to spend the night in a sleep centre and a technician must be available throughout. Full polysomnography is not necessary for diagnosis in most cases. l Limited sleep studies can measure thoraco-abdominal movement, oximetry, flow and heart rate. The limited sleep studies can be performed at home, although there is reduced sensitivity and specificity, compared to full polysomnography. Treatment Treatment depends on the severity of disease, underlying medical conditions and patient compliance. Management should consist firstly of correction of treatable and potentially reversible factors. l Who to treat. Patients who have a sleep study showing a > 4% oxygen saturation dip more than 10 times an hour should be referred for treatment. Treatment is also necessary in those with mild OSAHS who are symptomatic or have complications. Behavioural interventions Weight loss can reduce symptoms, as can smoking cessation and avoidance of alcohol, sedatives and sleeping tablets. Some patients may benefit from sleeping on their side. Keeping the nose as clear as possible, with the use of nasal decongestants if required, may improve symptoms. Treatment of underlying conditions such as hypothyroidism may greatly improve symptoms of OSAHS. The above measures may alleviate symptoms in patients who snore or have mild OSAHS. However, in those with more severe disease, additional treatment, as well as behavioural change, is likely to be required and should not be delayed. Non-surgical interventions l NIV • CPAP. This involves wearing a tight-fitting mask during sleep, which delivers pressure via air tubing from a flow generator in the Respiratory disease region of 5–10 mmHg. The pressure splints open the pharynx and prevents collapse, allowing unobstructed breathing and an undisturbed night. Nasal CPAP is currently the treatment of choice. There are machines available that automatically ‘hunt’ the pressure required to overcome the collapse of the airway. Supplemental oxygen can be delivered via the machine if oxygen saturations are low, such as in COPD patients. Treatment with CPAP improves symptoms and may improve BP. Once patients are established on CPAP, they are likely to require it for life. However, compliance is poor because of the discomfort and noise. Other side-effects include rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal bridge abrasions, claustrophobia and abdominal bloating. • Intra-oral devices. Mandibular advancement devices may be worn at night; by holding the lower jaw forward, they increase the space behind the tongue and thus pharyngeal volume. This improves airflow. Alternatives include tongue-retaining devices, which hold the tongue forward. These devices need to be made individually and are useful in patients with mild OSAHS and for snorers. l Pharmacological treatment • Supplementary oxygen may benefit a small subset of patients, especially those living at altitude. • Modafinil 200–400 mg daily (100 mg in the elderly) in the morning is a wake-promoting drug that is a potential adjunctive therapy. There are, however, ongoing debates regarding its efficacy. Surgery The aims of surgery are to increase the calibre of the pharynx and thus reduce pharyngeal resistance during sleep. l Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty involves resection of the uvula, redundant retro-lingual soft tissue and palatine tonsillar tissue if present. The outcome is difficult to predict and it is not uniformly successful. Sideeffects include post-operative pain, changes in voice and nasal regurgitation of food. In addition, patients are more likely to have difficulty with CPAP following surgery. l Tonsillectomy may help patients with large tonsils. l Tracheostomy is only used in patients with life-threatening apnoea in whom all other treatments have failed. It works by bypassing the obstruction. Mandibular advancement, suprahyoid tensing, weight reduction surgery and nasal surgery have been used but there is insufficient evidence to recommend these treatments. Driving It is the doctor’s responsibility to inform the patient of the risks associated with continued driving, even if the diagnosis is clinically suspected but not yet formally diagnosed. Once a diagnosis is made, patients must be told verbally and in writing that it is their responsibility to inform the authorities.


QA : 




1. Q: What is obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS)? (Good)
   A: OSAHS is a syndrome caused by abnormal size and/or collapsibility of the pharynx during sleep, which disrupts sleep and causes symptoms.


2. Q: What percentage of the population does OSAHS affect? (Good)
   A: OSAHS affects 1-2% of the population.


3. Q: Who is commonly affected by OSAHS? (Good)
   A: OSAHS is commonly seen in overweight, middle-aged men.


4. Q: How does OSAHS disrupt sleep? (Good)
   A: OSAHS disrupts sleep by causing intermittent and repeated collapse of the upper airways during sleep.


5. Q: What are the three possible outcomes of upper airway collapse during sleep in OSAHS? (Good)
   A: The three possible outcomes are total obstruction of the airway with no respiratory flow (apnoea), snoring due to partial collapse, and reduced flow (hypopnoea) with critical collapse.


6. Q: What happens during apnoea in OSAHS? (Good)
   A: Apnoea results in hypoxia and increasingly strenuous respiratory efforts until the patient overcomes the resistance and resumes breathing.


7. Q: How does OSAHS affect REM sleep and sleep deprivation? (Good)
   A: OSAHS can result in reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and sleep deprivation because patients may wake up hundreds of times per night due to increased respiratory effort and central hypoxic stimulation.


8. Q: What factors predispose someone to OSAHS? (Good)
   A: Factors predisposing to OSAHS include increasing age, male gender, obesity, sedative drugs, smoking, and alcohol consumption.


9. Q: What is the differential diagnosis for OSAHS? (Good)
   A: The differential diagnosis includes central sleep apnoea, which is due to impairment of central ventilatory control secondary to brainstem pathology and is seen in non-obese patients with no history of snoring.


10. Q: What are the common symptoms of OSAHS? (Good)
    A: The common symptoms of OSAHS include excessive daytime somnolence (90%), impaired concentration, and loud snoring (95%). Patients may experience falling asleep at work, while driving, or in mid-conversation.


11. Q: How can daytime sleepiness be assessed in patients with suspected OSAHS? (Good)
    A: Patients with suspected OSAHS can be asked to complete an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess daytime sleepiness. The scale ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater daytime sleepiness.


12. Q: What should be included in the examination of a patient with suspected OSAHS? (Good)
    A: The examination should include recording weight, height, neck circumference, blood pressure, a full examination of the nose, oral cavity, and upper airways, as well as a complete respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological assessment.


13. Q: What are the complications associated with OSAHS? (Good)
    A: OSAHS has been associated with hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and an increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Decompensation with hypercapnic respiratory failure or cor pulmonale may occur, especially in patients with co-existing COPD.


14. Q: When should patients with suspected OSAHS be referred to a specialist sleep center? (Good)
    A: Patients with an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), those with symptoms suggestive of OSAHS and sleepiness in dangerous situations (e.g., driving or operating hazardous equipment), and those with likely OSAHS and COPD should be referred to a specialist sleep center.


15. Q: What are the primary treatment options for OSAHS? (Good)
    A: The primary treatment options for OSAHS include behavioral interventions (weight loss, smoking cessation, avoiding alcohol and sedatives), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, and surgery (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tonsillectomy).


16. Q: What is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy? (Good)
    A: CPAP therapy involves wearing a tight-fitting mask during sleep, which delivers a continuous stream of pressurized air to keep the upper airway open and prevent its collapse.


17. Q: What are the surgical options for OSAHS? (Good)
    A: Surgical options for OSAHS include uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), tonsillectomy, and tracheostomy. UPPP involves the removal of the uvula, redundant retro-lingual soft tissue, and palatine tonsillar tissue if present. Tracheostomy is only used in severe, life-threatening cases where other treatments have failed.


18. Q: How does weight loss help in the management of OSAHS? (Good)
    A: Weight loss helps in the management of OSAHS by reducing excess fat tissue in the neck and improving the collapsibility of the upper airway.


19. Q: What are the potential side effects of CPAP therapy? (Good)
    A: Potential side effects of CPAP therapy include nasal congestion, nasal dryness, skin irritation, mask discomfort, claustrophobia, and aerophagia (swallowing air).


20. Q: What are the responsibilities regarding driving and OSAHS?(Not Good)
    A: It is the doctor's responsibility to inform patients of the risks associated with continued driving, even if the diagnosis of OSAHS is suspected but not yet formally diagnosed. Once diagnosed, patients must be informed verbally and in writing that it is their responsibility to inform the authorities about their condition.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessively inherited disease with an incidence of 1 in 2500 and a calculated carrier frequency of 1 in 25 in the UK. It is more common in the Caucasian population. Cystic fibrosis Genetics l CF is caused by a genetic mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene, which codes for a protein known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. The gene is situated on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21.3→7q22.1). l The commonest mutation in the European population is δF508, which is found in about 70% of affected cases and causes defective synthesis, defective maturation, blocked activation or defective function of the CFTR protein. Pathophysiology l The CFTR protein is essential for regulation and transport of electrolytes across the epithelial cell and intracellular membranes. In the presence of a mutant CFTR protein, chloride channels in the epithelial cells fail to open in response to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), leading to a decreased excretion of chloride ions and an increased reabsorption of sodium. As a result, less water is secreted into the airways, making the secretions more tenacious and viscous, more difficult to expectorate, and prone to infection. There is a continuous cycle of infection and inflammation, resulting in severe airway damage, bronchiectasis and loss of respiratory function. l In the sweat ducts a similar process results in increased concentrations of sweat sodium and chloride, which is useful for diagnosis. Other organs involved include the pancreas, liver, biliary tree and gut. Clinical features Respiratory The commonest presentation is with recurrent respiratory infections. A cough productive of purulent sputum in childhood eventually results in bronchiectasis and chronic airway obstruction. Increased breathlessness occurs as the disease develops. Other pulmonary complications include haemoptysis, pneumothorax and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Eventually, cor pulmonale and respiratory failure develop. Nasal polyps and purulent sinusitis occur. Physical signs include clubbing, cyanosis, wheeze and scattered coarse crackles. l Infection is a major problem. The bacteria are described in the treatment section. Colonization with Burkholderia cepacia is an increasing problem. It is multi-resistant and is spread by patient-to-patient contact, resulting in clinic segregation and the end of ‘CF holidays’. l Clinically, one-third of patients have no change in symptoms or lung function, in one-third there is deterioration of lung function, and in one-third there is rapid deterioration resulting in death, even in patients with previous mild disease. The latter is known as ‘cepacia syndrome’. l Viral infections also occur. Gastrointestinal About 85% of patients have pancreatic insufficiency from birth, resulting in malabsorption of fat and protein, and causing steatorrhoea and malnutrition. Infants and children may present with failure to thrive, diarrhoea or acute pancreatitis. Bowel obstruction secondary to meconium ileus (10%) can occur soon after birth; if it occurs later in life, it is known as ‘meconium ileus equivalent’ or ‘distal intestinal obstructive syndrome’ Respiratory disease (DIOS). These patients present with volvulus or rectal prolapse. Biliary obstruction may result in cholecystitis, while chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can lead to portal hypertension, varices and splenomegaly. There is an increased prevalence of gallstones (especially cholesterol), reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal malignancy in CF. Endocrine There is gradual loss of pancreatic islet cells with the development of diabetes mellitus in about 11% of adult patients with CF. Diabetic ketoacidosis is rare. Male patients are infertile as a result of failure of the vas deferens and epididymis to develop. Female patients are able to conceive but their fertility may be reduced secondary to thickened cervical mucus. Other Puberty and skeletal maturity are delayed in many CF patients. Growth retardation, demineralization and osteoarthropathy may occur. Patients on long-term steroids may develop osteoporosis (p. 585). Diagnosis and investigations l Positive family history. l Sweat test. This is the gold standard test for diagnosis of CF and must be performed in an experienced laboratory. Sweat is collected with pilocarpine iontophoresis; chloride levels with CF are > 60 mmol/L. The test can be repeated the day after receiving fludrocortisone 3 mg/m2 for 2 days, when the sweat electrolyte concentration fails to suppress into the normal range in CF patients. l Nasal potential difference. Normal values are −10 to −30 mV; in CF they are −34 to −60 mV. The test is performed in specialist centres. l Genotyping. The diagnosis can be confirmed if two abnormal mutations (see above) are found. l Radiology. A CXR or CT showing enlarged lung volumes and evidence of bronchiectasis supports a diagnosis of CF. l Pancreatic insufficiency. This is demonstrated by a low stool elastase, abnormal pancreatic stimulation tests or fat malabsorption. Treatment The main aims of therapy should be to reduce exacerbations and hospitalization, enhance quality of life, prevent complications (particularly those associated with treatment) and improve mortality. l Management. Management requires a multi-disciplinary team and is best provided in centres that specialize in CF. l Clinic visits. Spirometry, blood tests (including vitamins and Aspergillus precipitins), CXR and a physiotherapy and dietician review should be carried out. l Respiratory management. The aim of respiratory therapy is to decrease the number and pathogenicity of the infecting organism and suppress the lung’s hyper-responsive immune system. This can be achieved with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, bronchodilators and airway clearance techniques. There is no good clinical evidence for the use of oxygen. In hypoxic patients, oxygen may delay or prevent the complications of chronic hypoxia, as it does in COPD. Oxygen may also be used during exercise. Cystic fibrosis Antibiotics Routine sputum cultures and sensitivities guide antibiotic therapy. There is no overall consensus on the use of prophylactic antibiotics and duration of treatment. l Acute respiratory exacerbations. IV antibiotics may be required if there is bacterial resistance to all orally administered antibiotics and if oral antibiotics fail to resolve symptoms. FEV1 and CRP can be used to monitor response to therapy. • Staph. aureus. Antibiotics (p. 77) such as continuous twice-daily oral flucloxacillin are usually prescribed if there is evidence of chronic colonization. Continuous prophylactic antibiotics are used in patients with frequent recurrent exacerbations. Despite prophylaxis, isolates of Staph. aureus require high-dose flucloxacillin and an additional antibiotic such as sodium fusidate, azithromycin/erythromycin, clindamycin or rifampicin. Patients with severe exacerbations should receive a second-generation cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside or vancomycin for at least 10–14 days. • H. influenzae. All isolates should be regarded as pathogenic. A 2-week course of a macrolide or ampicillin should usually treat H. influenzae, although resistance is common. Persistent infection can be treated with cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime, which should be continued until there is a sustained improvement in symptoms. Patients with repeated isolates despite the above measures should receive continuous oral antibiotics chosen according to sensitivities. • Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Once isolates are identified, aggressive treatment must be initiated to delay chronic colonization. Strategies for the first isolation of P. aeruginosa include: a) oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily plus nebulized colomycin 1–2 MU twice daily or tobramycin/gentamicin for 3 weeks; a 2-week course of IV antipseudomonal antibiotics is given, delaying the introduction of continuous antibiotic inhalation until subsequent positive cultures or b) combined use of nebulized colomycin plus gentamicin or tobramycin, followed by intensive oral or IV antibiotic therapy. The exact duration of therapy is controversial. Many prescribe a 3-month course. Management of chronic infection varies and includes a regular IV antibiotic, irrespective of clinical state. Antimicrobial sensitivities should be checked regularly for appropriate therapy. a) A β-lactam in combination with an aminoglycoside is recommended as first-line in patients colonized with P. aeruginosa. Treatments should be given for 10–14 days but may need to be continued for longer if the patient has persistent symptoms. b) Combination therapy reduces antibiotic resistance and can produce synergistic effects. c) Oral ciprofloxacin can be used to treat mild exacerbation but is not sufficient as monotherapy if there is concomitant Staph. aureus infection. d) Nebulized antipseudomonal antibiotic treatment, such as tobramycin 300 mg nebulized 12-hourly for 28 days, alternating with 28 days off, decreases P. aeruginosa colonization. Many patients receive IV antibiotics at home, although a test dose is usually given in hospital first. Colomycin 1–2 MU twice daily Respiratory disease can cause bronchoconstriction, so a test dose should always be given. l Long-term management. Azithromycin 500 mg orally results in improved lung function and reduced exacerbations in patients colonized with P. aeruginosa. It has immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory actions.

Bronchodilators Airflow obstruction occurs in CF secondary to mucus plugs, bronchial wall thickening due to inflammation and airway destruction. In addition, bronchial hyper-reactivity is common. An improvement in FEV1 can be seen in response to β2 agonists such as salbutamol 2–4 puffs 2–4 times daily. Beta2 agonists are also helpful prior to physiotherapy to facilitate clearance of airway secretions. Long-acting β2 agonists should be reserved for patients who show clear benefit. Antimuscarinics, such as inhaled ipratropium bromide 2–4 puffs 2–4 times daily, can also be used. Anti-inflammatory agents l Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids, e.g. prednisolone 20 mg daily, can be helpful in patients with recurrent wheeze. Alternate-day prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg improves lung function over 24 months. Side-effects (p. 585) are many, so oral corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use. They are useful in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (a common complication of CF) or resistant bronchospasm and in patients who are profoundly ill and not responding to maximal therapy. Osteopenia (p. 324) prophylaxis is given. Airway clearance l Recombinant DNase. DNase can be used to decrease sputum viscosity by cleaving long strands of DNA into smaller ones. The usual dose is dornase alfa 2500 U (2.5 mg) once daily via a jet nebulizer. The most common side-effect is voice alteration; others include pharyngitis, laryngitis, conjunctivitis and chest pain. l Hypertonic saline. Short-term studies have shown benefit from inhaled hypertonic saline in concentrations of up to 7%. Beta2 agonists should be inhaled prior to administration to limit bronchospasm. l N-acetylcysteine. Although this can reduce sputum viscosity, there are no RCTs that show benefit from its use. l NIV. This may be used to improve symptoms in chronic respiratory failure or as a bridge to lung transplantation. There is no evidence of a survival benefit. l Lung transplantation. In CF FEV1 can be used as a predictor of mortality. Once FEV1 is < 30% predicted, mean survival is about 2 years and patients should be referred to a specialized unit for assessment for lung transplantation. Respiratory complications l Haemoptysis, which is usually mild, is common during exacerbations but massive haemoptysis also occurs (see Box 13.1). l Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis does not seem to affect the clinical course of most patients without an allergic component. A four-fold rise in total serum IgE, associated with IgG precipitins to Aspergillus and large fleeting changes on the CXR, favour allergic Cystic fibrosis bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Treatment is with corticosteroids. The role of itraconazole remains controversial; however, some transplant centres recommend its use for the suppression of Aspergillus prior to transplantation. l Pneumothorax should be treated in the conventional way (p. 529). Pleural stripping procedures to prevent recurrence may be a contraindication to subsequent lung transplantation. Extrapulmonary disease Gastrointestinal disease l Pancreatic enzyme supplements. Pancreatic enzyme supplements (enteric-coated microspheres and mini-tablets) contain lipase, protease and amylase, and are taken with meals and snacks. Most adults take 4–8 tablets with main meals and 2–4 tablets with snacks; however, they learn to adjust the dosage to achieve normal stools. Pancreatin is available in a number of different strengths depending on the amount of lipase in the preparation (e.g. 10000, 25 000 and 40 000 units). Largebowel strictures have been associated with these high-strength preparations. Increasing the jejunal pH with a protein pump inhibitor or an H2 antagonist can improve absorption. l Nutrition. Patients should eat a normal healthy diet with a high calorie intake. If they are unable to maintain an adequate weight, overnight enteral feeding via a gastrostomy or naso-gastric tube can be used. Good nutritional status (multi-vitamin preparation daily) is associated with an improved prognosis and dietitians should be involved. Vitamin supplementation is given with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K 10 mg daily. Iron-deficient patients should receive iron. l Distal intestinal obstruction (DIOS). DIOS can be treated with a nasogastric tube for decompression, IV fluids, correction of electrolytes, and a combination of enemas and laxatives. Mineral oil and fleet enemas may be used initially, as may oral laxatives such as senna and lactulose. In severe cases, gastrograffin or N-acetylcysteine is given orally or naso-gastrically and as an enema. Surgery is sometimes required. As DIOS is a recurring condition, the patient is given regular pancreatic supplements and regular laxatives once symptoms are relieved. Liver disease l Ursodeoxycholic acid leads to clinical and biochemical improvement but does not modify the course of chronic liver disease. l Gallstones may require a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, anaesthesia is not without risk due to lung disease. Endocrine disease l Diabetes. Over 65% of patients have glucose intolerance by the age of 25. A blood glucose test should be performed 3-monthly. CF patients with diabetes are encouraged to eat a high-calorie diet to maintain growth and weight; insulin should be adjusted accordingly. l Fertility • Women. Fertility is usually normal and the oral contraceptive pill works in normal doses. For pregnancy, ideally the FEV1 should be > 50% predicted and patients with an FEV1 < 30% should be advised against pregnancy. Partners should undergo DNA analysis prior to conception. Teratogenic drugs should be avoided. Quinolones, aminoglycosides and DNase should also be avoided. Respiratory disease • Men. Male patients (98%) are infertile. They should receive seminal analysis and their partner should have DNA analysis. In vitro fertilization using aspiration of sperm and intracytoplasmic gamete injection can be successful.

2. Q: How do beta2 agonists like salbutamol improve lung function in cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: Beta2 agonists like salbutamol improve lung function in cystic fibrosis by dilating the bronchial smooth muscles, relieving bronchial constriction, and improving airflow.


3. Q: When should beta2 agonists be used prior to physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: Beta2 agonists should be used prior to physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis to facilitate the clearance of airway secretions.


4. Q: What is the role of antimuscarinics in the treatment of cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: Antimuscarinics, such as inhaled ipratropium bromide, can be used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis to help bronchodilation and reduce bronchial hyper-reactivity. The recommended dosage is 2-4 puffs, 2-4 times daily.


5. Q: What is the role of corticosteroids in the management of cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, can be helpful in patients with recurrent wheeze in cystic fibrosis. They may improve lung function over time, but their use is associated with many side effects, so they are not recommended for routine use.


6. Q: What is the recommended dose of dornase alfa (recombinant DNase) for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: The usual dose of dornase alfa is 2500 U (2.5 mg) once daily via a jet nebulizer. It helps decrease sputum viscosity by cleaving long strands of DNA into smaller ones.


7. Q: What are the common side effects of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis patients? (Good)
   A: The common side effects of dornase alfa (recombinant DNase) in cystic fibrosis patients include voice alteration, pharyngitis, laryngitis, conjunctivitis, and chest pain.


8. Q: What is the role of hypertonic saline in airway clearance for cystic fibrosis? (Good)
   A: Short-term studies have shown benefit from inhaled hypertonic saline in concentrations of up to 7% for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis. Beta2 agonists should be inhaled prior to its administration to limit bronchospasm.


9. Q: Is there evidence supporting the use of N-acetylcysteine for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis? (Not Good)
   A: There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that show benefit from the use of N-acetylcysteine for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis.


10. Q: What is the purpose of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in cystic fibrosis? (Good)
    A: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be used in cystic fibrosis to improve symptoms in chronic respiratory failure or as a bridge to lung transplantation. However, there is no evidence of a survival benefit.

Non-pharmacological therapies l Physiotherapy and airway clearance techniques. Physiotherapy should be performed at least twice a day and increased during exacerbations. A number of techniques and devices are employed including postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques and ‘huffing’. Mechanical devices are also used, such as flutter valves, external oscillation thoracic jackets, and low-and high-pressure positive expiratory pressure devices. Exercise should be used in combination with physiotherapy, as it can help mobilize secretions and is part of patients’ pulmonary rehabilitation. l Other therapies • Sodium chloride tablets. These may be required in hot weather due to excess sodium chloride loss in sweat. • Gene therapy. This is currently unavailable, mainly due to problems with vectors and delivery, but may be a treatment of the future. • Vaccinations. Patients should receive pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 0.5 mL IM and a yearly influenza vaccination. Prognosis The current average age of death of patients with CF is about 30 years old. However, the life expectancy of a newborn baby with CF today is about 45–50 years old without gene therapy. ASTHMA Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. It has three characteristics: airway hyper-responsiveness to a wide range of stimuli, reversible airflow limitation and inflammation of the bronchi. It is more common in developed countries and the prevalence is increasing, particularly in the second decade of life when the disease affects 10–15% of the population. Pathophysiology The development of asthma is likely to be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Extrinsic asthma usually occurs in atopic individuals and is associated with a positive skin prick reaction to common inhalant allergens. Late-onset asthma in adults can be due to sensitization to chemicals or biological products at work, aspirin intolerance or stimulation following β-adrenoceptor blockers prescribed for hypertension or angina. Intrinsic asthma is often described as ‘late-onset’, as it usually starts in middle age. However, many patients developing late-onset asthma have a positive skin prick test and on close questioning actually had childhood symptoms compatible with asthma. Clinical features Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath and chest tightness occur. These symptoms are intermittent, variable, worse at night and provoked by triggers such as exercise. Cough variant asthma is cough without a wheeze. There is often a family history of asthma or other atopic disease, such as eczema or hay fever, and patients often know triggers that worsen symptoms. Physical signs There may be no signs of airflow obstruction present at the time of examination. If wheeze is not present, the patient is asked to do a forced expiratory manœuvre, which may provoke an audible wheeze. During an exacerbation there may be tachypnoea, use of accessory muscles, wheeze and pulsus paradoxus, but in a severe exacerbation the chest may be silent (i.e. no airflow). Eczema, hives or allergic rhinitis may be present, indicating other allergic disease. Nasal polyps may be found with or without an associated history of aspirin sensitivity. Churg–Strauss syndrome is a triad of asthma (with rhinitis), eosinophilia and systemic vasculitis. Investigations l Respiratory function tests can be normal (if there is no airflow limitation) or show an obstructive airflow picture. There is a reduced FEV1 and a proportionally smaller reduction in FVC, resulting in an FEV1:FVC ratio of < 75%. The PEFR is also reduced, but variability of PEFR and/ or FEV1 over time is diagnostic of asthma. • PEFR meters are inexpensive and easy to use, and patients can therefore be taught to use them at home. Measurements of PEFR on waking (prior to taking a bronchodilator) and before bed (after a bronchodilator) are useful in showing diurnal variation (see Fig. 13.2). An increase of 20% in PEFR after inhalation of a short-acting β-agonist, e.g. 400 mcg of salbutamol via a metered dose inhaler or after a trial or oral steroids (prednisolone 30 mg/day for 14 days), occurs in asthma. Patients with severe chronic asthma may have little reversibility. • Patients should be encouraged to keep PEFR diaries. Those with possible occupational asthma should record PEFR for at least 2 weeks at work and 2 weeks off work. • Exercise tests show a reduction in PEF or FEV1 after 6 mins exercise. l Histamine or methacholine bronchial provocation tests can be used to indicate the presence of bronchial hyper-responsiveness. l Blood and sputum tests may reveal increased eosinophils (> 0.4 × 109 /L) and total IgE in the peripheral blood, indicating an allergic tendency. Eosinophils may also be elevated in the sputum. Radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) measure minute quantities of IgE antibody in the blood, which are specifically directed at particular antigens. However, they are expensive and less sensitive than skin prick tests. l CXR shows no characteristic features. It is done at diagnosis and always in a severe exacerbation to exclude a pneumothorax. l Skin prick tests should be performed in all cases to try to identify an allergic cause. Allergen provocation tests are useful if occupational asthma is suspected. l Exhaled nitric oxide measurement indicates the degree of inflammation and is used as a test for the efficacy of corticosteroids. Management The aims of treatment are symptom control, reduction of exacerbations and restoration of normal or best possible lung function with minimal side-effects from medication, minimal absences from work or school, and no limitation on physical activity. In children treatment is to enable a normal growth pattern to occur.




QA : 


1. Q: What are some non-pharmacological therapies for asthma? (Good)
   A: Non-pharmacological therapies for asthma include physiotherapy and airway clearance techniques such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, and the use of mechanical devices like flutter valves, external oscillation thoracic jackets, and low- and high-pressure positive expiratory pressure devices.


2. Q: What is the average age of death for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)? (Good)
   A: The current average age of death for patients with CF is about 30 years old.


3. Q: What is the life expectancy of a newborn baby with CF today? (Good)
   A: The life expectancy of a newborn baby with CF today is about 45-50 years old without gene therapy.


4. Q: What are the characteristics of asthma? (Good)
   A: Asthma is characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness to a wide range of stimuli, reversible airflow limitation, and inflammation of the bronchi.


5. Q: What are the possible causes of asthma development? (Good)
   A: The development of asthma is likely due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Extrinsic asthma is associated with atopy and positive skin prick reactions to common inhalant allergens. Late-onset asthma in adults can be due to sensitization to chemicals or biological products at work, aspirin intolerance, or stimulation following β-adrenoceptor blockers prescribed for hypertension or angina. Intrinsic asthma often starts in middle age and may have childhood symptoms compatible with asthma.


6. Q: What are the clinical features of asthma? (Good)
   A: The clinical features of asthma include intermittent and variable symptoms such as cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Symptoms are often worse at night and can be provoked by triggers such as exercise. Some individuals may have cough variant asthma without a wheeze. There is often a family history of asthma or other atopic diseases, and patients are aware of triggers that worsen their symptoms.


7. Q: What physical signs may be present in a patient with asthma? (Good)
   A: There may be no signs of airflow obstruction present at the time of examination. If wheeze is not present, the patient may be asked to perform a forced expiratory maneuver to provoke an audible wheeze. During an exacerbation, signs may include tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, wheeze, and pulsus paradoxus. In severe exacerbations, the chest may be silent with no airflow. Other allergic diseases such as eczema, hives, or allergic rhinitis may also be present, and nasal polyps may be found with or without an associated history of aspirin sensitivity.


8. Q: What investigations are useful in diagnosing asthma? (Good)
   A: Useful investigations for diagnosing asthma include respiratory function tests such as spirometry, which can show an obstructive airflow pattern. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements can assess diurnal variation and bronchodilator response. Histamine or methacholine bronchial provocation tests can indicate bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Blood and sputum tests may reveal increased eosinophils and total IgE, indicating an allergic tendency. Chest X-ray (CXR) is done to exclude other conditions, and skin prick tests and allergen provocation tests can help identify allergic triggers.


9. Q: What are the aims of asthma treatment? (Good)
   A: The aims of asthma treatment are symptom control, reduction of exacerbations, restoration of normal or best possible lung function, minimal side-effects from medication, minimal absences from work or school, and no limitation on physical activity. In children, treatment aims to enable a normal growth pattern.
 
10. Q: How can exercise be beneficial in cystic fibrosis management? (Good)
    A: Exercise is beneficial in cystic fibrosis management as it can help mobilize secretions and is part of patients' pulmonary rehabilitation when used in combination with physiotherapy.

aspirin-induced asthma, exercise-induced asthma or associated rhinitis, particularly if used in addition to an inhaled corticosteroid. Montelukast 10 mg daily in the evening and zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily are the most common leukotriene receptor antagonists used. l Theophylline is a bronchodilator and sustained-release preparations are used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in some cases of asthma. Modified release theophyllines include Slo-Phyllin 250–500 mg, Nuelin SA 250–500 mg and Uniphyllin Continus 200– 400 mg, all 12-hourly. Brand names must be stated on prescription. Table 13.4  The stepwise management of asthma Step PEFR Treatment 1  Occasional symptoms, less frequent than daily 100% predicted As-required short-acting β2 agonists If used more than once daily, move to step 2 2  Daily symptoms ≤ 80% predicted Regular inhaled preventer therapy Anti-inflammatory drugs: inhaled low-dose corticosteroids up to 800 mcg daily. LTRAs, theophylline and sodium cromoglicate are less effective If not controlled, move to step 3 3  Severe symptoms 50–80% predicted Inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting inhaled β2 agonist Continue inhaled corticosteroid Add regular inhaled LABA If still not controlled, add either LTRA, modified-release oral theophylline or β2 agonist If not controlled, move to step 4 4  Severe symptoms uncontrolled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 50–80% predicted High-dose inhaled corticosteroid and regular bronchodilators Increase high-dose inhaled corticosteroids up to 2000 mcg daily Plus regular LABAs Plus either LTRA or modified-release theophylline or β2 agonist 5  Severe symptoms deteriorating ≤ 50% predicted Regular oral corticosteroids Add prednisolone 40 mg daily to step 4 6  Severe symptoms deteriorating in spite of prednisolone ≤ 30% predicted Hospital admission LABA, long-acting β2 agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor agonist; PEFR, peak expiratory flow rate. Respiratory disease Theophyllines have a narrow therapeutic window and interact with a number of other drugs. Plasma levels should be between 10 and 20 mg/L for optimal response. Step 3: Add-on therapy If 400–800 mcg a day of inhaled steroid fails to control symptoms with good compliance, a trial of add-on therapy is used, instead of increasing inhaled corticosteroid dose. The add-on therapy of choice is a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA); when used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, these agents have been shown to improve lung function and symptoms in symptomatic patients taking low- and moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Choices include salmeterol 50 mcg (2 puffs) twice daily, increased up to 100 mcg (4 puffs) twice daily in severe disease, or formoterol 12 mcg 1–2 times daily, increased to 24 mcg daily in more severe disease. If there is an improvement but there are still symptoms, the LABA should be continued and the inhaled corticosteroid dose increased to 800 mcg a day. LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids can be given as combination therapy, which is more convenient for the patient. A combination of fluticasone and salmeterol and a combination of budesonide and formoterol are available. If there is no improvement in symptoms after addition of a LABA, it should be discontinued and the inhaled corticosteroid dose increased to 800 mcg daily. If control is still inadequate, one of the following is added: leukotriene receptor antagonists, modified-release oral theophylline or modified-release oral β2 agonist. Step 4: Persistent poor control If there is persistent poor control despite the combination of a short-acting β2 agonist as required, moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroid 800 mcg daily and add-on therapy (usually a LABA), one of the following can be used: l Increase inhaled corticosteroids to 2000 mcg a day (monitor for side-effects). l Do a 6-week sequential trial of one of the following: leukotriene receptor antagonist, modified-release oral theophylline or modified-release oral β2 agonist. l If the trial is ineffective, stop the medication; if inhaled corticosteroid is used, reduce to the original dose. Step 5: Continuous or frequent use oral corticosteroids Prednisolone is the oral corticosteroid of choice and should be used at the lowest dose that controls symptoms. Patients taking long-term steroids or 3–4 courses a year are at increased risk of side-effects (p. 324). Patients receiving steroids for more than 3 months should be prescribed a longacting bisphosphonate to prevent osteoporosis. BP and blood glucose should be checked regularly. Methods of trying to decrease oral steroids include maximizing other therapy and using maximal doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Immunosuppressants (steroid-sparing agents), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin or oral gold, can be tried for 3 months. Stepping down treatment Patients who are well controlled for 2–3 months should start decreasing their therapy. This should be done slowly and, where possible, the patient should be maintained on the lowest dose of inhaled steroid that controls symptoms. Reduction should be considered every 3 months and the steroid dose should be reduced by 25–50% each time. Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibodies Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibodies (omalizumab) that form complexes with free IgE, blocking its interaction with mast cells and basophils, have been developed. However, although clinical trials have shown benefit in patients with severe asthma despite corticosteroids, omalizumab is not regularly prescribed. Omalizumab is given subcutaneously 2–4 times weekly.


QA : 




1. Q: What should clinicians do regarding patient education in asthma management? (Good)
   A: Clinicians should regularly check their patients' inhaler technique and teach them to use a PEFR meter. They should also provide information about the condition to patients and their families.


2. Q: What are some signs of poor control in asthma that patients should recognize? (Good)
   A: Patients should learn to recognize signs of poor control in asthma, such as increasing need for short-acting β-agonists, increasing breathlessness on exertion, and waking at night with symptoms.


3. Q: Are there any recommendations for pre-natal or post-natal allergen avoidance in asthma management? (Not Good)
   A: Currently, there are no recommendations on pre-natal or post-natal allergen avoidance in asthma management.


4. Q: What is the association between breastfeeding and infant wheeze? (Not Good)
   A: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced infant wheeze.


5. Q: What is the "hygiene hypothesis" in relation to allergic disease prevention? (Good)
   A: The "hygiene hypothesis" suggests that early exposure to microbial products may prevent allergic diseases such as asthma by switching off allergic responses. However, there is currently no good evidence for this hypothesis.


6. Q: What is the association between smoking and infant wheeze? (Good)
   A: Smoking during pregnancy and after the child is born is associated with increased infant wheeze.


7. Q: What measures can be taken for allergen avoidance in asthma management? (Good)
   A: Measures should be taken to avoid causative allergens, such as pets, mold, and certain foods. In observational studies, asthma symptoms have improved after removing a pet from the house. However, measures to avoid house dust mites have been shown to be ineffectual.


8. Q: Which drugs should not be used in asthma treatment? (Good)
   A: Aspirin, other NSAIDs, and β-blockers should not be used in asthma treatment.


9. Q: What is the mainstay of treatment for asthma? (Good)
   A: The mainstay of treatment for asthma involves the use of inhaled therapies that are delivered as aerosols or powders directly into the lungs.


10. Q: What is the stepwise approach to asthma treatment? (Good)
    A: Asthma treatment involves a stepwise approach, where patients and doctors can increase or decrease medication according to symptoms. The approach is based on the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory disease, and anti-inflammatory drugs should be started, even in mild cases. Short-acting bronchodilators are used for symptom relief only.

Management of acute exacerbations of asthma The best strategy for management of acute exacerbations of asthma is early recognition and prevention. Patients should have an action plan and know how to identify the onset of an exacerbation. The signs of an onset include worsening PEFR, increasing symptoms or greater use of inhaled shortacting β2 agonists. Patients should, at this stage, avoid precipitating factors, use inhaled β2 agonists for symptom relief and start on a course of oral corticosteroids. If there is no improvement or they are getting worse, they should immediately seek medical help. History, examination and evaluation Patients often present with increasing shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness or cough. Those at increased risk of severe acute exacerbations of asthma can be identified in the history. Previous near-fatal asthma attacks requiring ICU admission, previous hospital admissions within the last year, previous attacks requiring corticosteroids, a need for three or more classes of drug for asthma, increased use of β2 agonists (more than 2 canisters a month), known brittle asthma and repeated A&E attendance within the last year indicate patients who are at risk. Patients who are non-compliant with treatment, fail to attend hospital appointments, usually self-discharge from hospital or have any psychological or behavioural illness are also at risk of developing severe exacerbations of asthma. Severity of disease l Moderate asthma exacerbation involves: • PEFR 50–75% predicted • increasing symptoms • no signs of acute severe or life-threatening asthma. l Acute severe asthma typically involves one of: • PEF 33–50% predicted or best • inability to complete a sentence in one breath • respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min • tachycardia > 110 bpm. l Life-threatening asthma has features including: • PEF < 33% predicted or best • a silent chest • cyanosis • feeble respiratory effort • exhaustion, confusion or coma • bradycardia or hypotension • normal PaCO2 (4.6–6 kPa) • SpO2 < 92% or PaO2 < 8 kPa. Investigations l CXR should be performed to exclude a pneumothorax or consolidation. l PEFR is used to stratify patients according to disease severity (see above), and to inform decisions as to intensity of treatment and whether Respiratory disease patients should be treated in hospital or at home. Measurements should be repeated regularly to gauge response to therapy. Normal values vary according to size and age but a peak flow < 200 usually indicates severe airflow obstruction. Often patients with exacerbations are too breathless to perform a PEFR. l ABGs should be measured in patients requiring hospital admission who have oxygen saturations < 92% or features of acute severe or lifethreatening asthma. Abnormal PaCO2 is a sign of life-threatening asthma and impending respiratory failure, possibly requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. l Pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturations throughout admission. Treatment l Assess the patient. Tachycardia, a high respiratory rate and an inability to speak in sentences indicate a severe attack. l Apply high-flow oxygen (usually 40–60%), to maintain saturation > 92%. l If PEFR is < 150 L/min (in adults), administer nebulized salbutamol 5 mg or terbutaline 10 mg — driven via oxygen. (Use a low-reading meter, as ordinary meters measure from 60 L/min upwards.) l Give 200 mg IV hydrocortisone or prednisolone 40–50 mg orally. In severe asthma not responding to the initial nebulizer: l Repeat the salbutamol or terbutaline nebulizer at 15–30 min intervals or give continuous nebulization of salbutamol at 5–10 mg/hour (a special nebulizer is required). l Add nebulized ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg 4–6-hourly to the nebulized salbutamol/terbutaline. l Measure ABGs; if PaCO2 is > 7 kPa, consider ventilation. If PaCO2 is normal, monitor closely, as mechanical ventilation may be required. l Take a CXR to exclude pneumothorax. l If there is no improvement, magnesium sulphate IV 1.2–2 g over 20 mins, salbutamol IV 3–20 mcg/min, terbutaline IV 1.5–5 mcg/min or aminophylline loading dose (if not on maintenance oral therapy) 5 mg/kg over 20 mins, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/kg/ hour can be used. l Corticosteroids. Steroid therapy is given to reverse the underlying airway inflammation. It is associated with an improved outcome in exacerbations of asthma and should be given as early as possible (Fig. 13.2). IV steroids (hydrocortisone 400 mg daily in 4 divided doses) are usually given. Oral steroids (prednisolone 40–50 mg daily) are as effective, provided the patient is able to swallow. Oral steroids should be continued until resolution of acute symptoms and a return to usual daily activities, and until a PEFR within 80% of the patient’s best or predicted has been obtained. They do not need to be tapered if the course is shorter than 3 weeks, provided patients are on an appropriate dose of inhaled corticosteroids. l Antibiotics. There is no evidence that antibiotics are beneficial, as exacerbations are usually caused by viruses. Antibiotics should be reserved for cases where bacteria are cultured from the sputum or blood, or there is consolidation on CXR. l IV fluids and correction of electrolytes. Many patients are dehydrated and require fluid replacement. They may develop hypokalaemia due to β2 agonists and this should be corrected.
l Helium oxygen mixtures. These can be useful in exacerbations of asthma although evidence is lacking. l Intensive care. Patients should be referred to ICU for possible endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation if they are not responding to treatment, i.e. there is persistent hypoxia, hypercapnia, confusion, drowsiness, deteriorating PEFR, increasing acidosis or respiratory arrest. NIV is not usually used in patients with severe exacerbations of asthma and should only be in an HDU/ICU setting. Discharge In moderate asthma, patients may quickly improve with nebulized therapy and may not require hospital admission. Their regular treatment should be increased and they should commence a 2-week course of oral prednisolone. If they are safe to discharge, follow-up must be arranged. Hospitalized patients should be established on a drug regimen that they can safely take at home, and have a PEFR > 75% best or predicted and a diurnal variation of < 25% prior to discharge. Follow-up by a respiratory physician should be arranged. Management of catastrophic sudden severe (brittle) asthma This is a variant of asthma in which patients with well-controlled asthma suddenly develop severe asthma attacks and are at risk of sudden death. These patients require a detailed management plan for an exacerbation. On developing a wheeze they should go immediately to the nearest hospital and may require admission straight to ICU. Oxygen, resuscitation equipment, prednisolone 60 mg and nebulized β2 agonists should be kept at home and at work. Patients should wear a MedicAlert bracelet and carry two self-injectable 0.3 mg adrenaline (epinephrine) syringes with them at all times.






QA : 


Q1: What is the best strategy for managing acute exacerbations of asthma? (Good)
A1: The best strategy for managing acute exacerbations of asthma is early recognition and prevention. Patients should have an action plan and know how to identify the onset of an exacerbation. They should avoid precipitating factors, use inhaled β2 agonists for symptom relief, and start a course of oral corticosteroids.


Q2: How can patients identify the onset of an asthma exacerbation? (Good)

Q3: What are the indicators of increased risk for severe acute exacerbations of asthma? (Good)
A3: Indicators of increased risk for severe acute exacerbations of asthma include previous near-fatal asthma attacks requiring ICU admission, previous hospital admissions within the last year, a need for three or more classes of drug for asthma, increased use of β2 agonists, known brittle asthma, and repeated A&E attendance within the last year. Non-compliance with treatment, failure to attend hospital appointments, self-discharge from hospital, and psychological or behavioral illness also increase the risk.


Q4: What are the severity categories for asthma exacerbations? (Good)
A4: The severity categories for asthma exacerbations are as follows:
- Moderate asthma exacerbation: PEFR 50-75% predicted, increasing symptoms, and no signs of acute severe or life-threatening asthma.
- Acute severe asthma: PEF 33-50% predicted or best, inability to complete a sentence in one breath, respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min, and tachycardia > 110 bpm.
- Life-threatening asthma: PEF < 33% predicted or best, silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory effort, exhaustion, confusion or coma, bradycardia or hypotension, normal PaCO2 (4.6-6 kPa), SpO2 < 92% or PaO2 < 8 kPa.


Q5: What investigations are recommended for asthma exacerbations? (Good)
A5: Investigations recommended for asthma exacerbations include chest X-ray (CXR) to exclude pneumothorax or consolidation, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements to assess disease severity and treatment response, arterial blood gases (ABGs) in patients requiring hospital admission with low oxygen saturations or features of acute severe or life-threatening asthma, and pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturations throughout admission.


Q6: What treatments are recommended for asthma exacerbations? (Good)
A6: The treatments recommended for asthma exacerbations include:
- High-flow oxygen to maintain saturation > 92%.
- Nebulized short-acting β2 agonists (salbutamol or terbutaline) if PEFR is < 150 L/min (in adults).
- IV or oral corticosteroids (hydrocortisone or prednisolone) to reverse airway inflammation.
- Consideration of additional therapies such as nebulized ipratropium bromide, magnesium sulfate IV, salbutamol IV infusion, terbutaline IV infusion, or aminophylline in severe cases.
- Antibiotics are generally not recommended unless there is evidence of bacterial infection.
- IV fluids and correction of electrolyte imbalances if needed.
- Intensive care referral for possible endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in non-responsive cases.

PNEUMONIA Pneumonia is an inflammation of the substance of the lungs. It can be classified by site (e.g. lobar, diffuse, bronchopneumonia) or by aetiological agent (e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal, aspiration, or due to radiotherapy or allergic mechanisms). Pneumonias can be community-acquired (CAP; commonest Strep. pneumoniae), hospital-acquired (often Gram-negative bacteria) or ventilator-associated (p. 548). Causes Strep pneumonia often follows a viral infection with influenza (p. 50) or parainfluenza viruses. Precipitating factors include cigarette smoking, alcohol excess, bronchiectasis, bronchial obstruction (e.g. carcinoma) or inhalation from oesophageal obstruction. IV drug users can contract a Staph. aureus infection and patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those having AIDS or receiving treatment with cytotoxic agents) develop pneumonia; the organisms include Pneumocystis jiroveci, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare and cytomegalovirus. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) The majority of patients with CAP are treated outside hospital with amoxicillin (see Fig. 13.4) but they should be reviewed at 48 hours. If the mild case has not improved or CAP is very severe, the patient should be admitted to hospital. There is a significant mortality, particularly in those over 65 years old. Overall mortality for those admitted to hospital is about 5%. Strep. pneumoniae accounts for the majority of cases and for two-thirds of the mortality. Clinical features This varies according to the infecting agent (Table 13.5) or the immune state of the patient. Following a radiological (Fig. 13.3) and microbiological (if possible) diagnosis of the pneumonia, an early assessment of the severity of the pneumonia must be made in order to admit the patient to a medical ward or to ICU. The CURB-65 (Box 13.3) is a useful guide for doing this. Referral to ICU will be necessary if there is a failure to respond with a CURB-65 score of over 3 or if there is progressive hypercapnia, persistent hypoxia, severe acidosis, shock and depression of consciousness. Investigations All hospitalized patients should have the following: l CXR. Repeat the CXR 6 weeks after discharge unless complications occur. • Strep. pneumoniae. Consolidation can lag behind clinical signs. • Mycoplasma. Usually one lobe is involved but infection can be bilateral. • Legionella. There is lobar and then multi-lobar shadowing, with the occasional small pleural effusion. Cavitation is rare. l Blood tests. FBC, U&E, LFTs and CRP. • Strep. pneumoniae. White cell count is > 15 × 109 /L (90% polymorphonuclear leucocytosis); ESR > 100 mm/hour; CRP > 100 mg/L. • Mycoplasma. White cell count is usually normal. • Legionella. There is lymphopenia without marked leucocytosis, hyponatraemia, hypoalbuminaemia and high serum levels of liver aminotransferases. l Other tests • Sputum culture. • Blood culture. • Pulse oximetry and ABG analysis. Specific tests for individual organisms are as follows: l Pneumococcal antigen • Counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) of sputum, urine and serum is 3–4 times more sensitive than sputum or blood cultures. • Urinary antigen test detects C-polysaccharide. This is rapid and unaffected by antibiotics; sensitivity is 65–80% and specificity about 80%. l Legionella antigen • Urinary antigen test detects only serogroup 1, which accounts for most of these infections. Sensitivity (~80%) and specificity are high (almost 99%). • Direct immunofluorescent staining of organism in the pleural fluid, sputum or bronchial washings is carried out. • Serum antibodies are less reliable. • Legionella is not visible on Gram staining. • Culture on special media is possible but takes up to 3 weeks. • Retrospective confirmation can be obtained by demonstrating a fourfold increase in antibody titre in the blood. • Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) tests on sputum samples are becoming available. l Mycoplasma • Measure serum antibodies (IgM and IgG) in acute and convalescent samples. Cold agglutinins are present in 50% of cases. Other methods of identification include complement-fixing antibodies and PCR. • A kit for PCR is becoming available. • NASBA tests are becoming available. l Chlamydia antibodies are sought by immunofluorescent complement fixation.


QA : 


1. Q: How can pneumonia be classified based on site or etiological agent? (Good)

5. Q: What factors determine the severity of pneumonia and the need for ICU referral? (Good)
   A: The severity of pneumonia and the need for ICU referral are determined by factors such as a CURB-65 score over 3, progressive hypercapnia, persistent hypoxia, severe acidosis, shock, and depression of consciousness.


6. Q: What investigations are recommended for hospitalized patients with pneumonia? (Good)
   A: Hospitalized patients with pneumonia should undergo a chest X-ray (CXR), blood tests including FBC, U&E, LFTs, and CRP, sputum and blood cultures, pulse oximetry, ABG analysis, and specific tests for individual organisms such as pneumococcal and Legionella antigen tests, as well as measuring serum antibodies for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia.


7. Q: How can Streptococcus pneumoniae be detected in pneumonia cases? (Good)

Management
Management of CAP is shown in Fig. 13.4.
The patient in hospital should be re-evaluated regularly by the nursing
staff, depending on the severity of the illness (see MEWS, p. 2).
l Antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible,
preferably in the A&E department. The choice of the antibiotic is inevitably empirical and directed towards Strep. pneumoniae, as this is the
commonest organism. Acquired antibiotic resistance is a concern but is
still rare in the UK.
• Mild uncomplicated CAP (CURB-65 0–1) is treated in the community
with amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily (in the UK), or with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or doxycycline 200 mg followed by 100 mg
daily (if penicillin-sensitive) for 5–7 days. The newer quinolones
(e.g. levofloxacin 500 mg 1–2 times daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg
once daily for 10 days) are used by some but increasing resistance is a concern and these agents are best reserved for patients with
co-morbidities.
• More severe infections require amoxicillin 500 mg–1 g 3 times daily
plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. If oral therapy is contraindicated, IV amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily or benzyl penicillin 1.2 g
4 times daily plus IV clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily is used. In 
Pneumonia
patients with high severity pneumonia (CURB 65 3–5), co-amoxiclav
1.2g 6–8-hourly is combined with IV clarithromycin 500 mg twice
daily.
• If Staph. aureus infection is suspected or is proven on culture, IV
flucloxacillin 1–2 g every 6 hours by slow IV injection or infusion ±
sodium fusidate 500 mg 3 times daily if over 50 kg by IV infusion
should be added. Quinolones are recommended for those intolerant
of penicillins or macrolides. Community-acquired meticillin-resistant
Staph. aureus (CA-MRSA) can be treated with vancomycin or
linezolid.
• Parenteral antibiotics should be switched to oral once the temperature has settled for a period of 24 hours and provided there is no
contraindication to oral therapy.
• Mycoplasma pneumonia is treated with a macrolide, e.g. clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (or azithromycin) for 7–10 days, or a tetracycline, e.g. doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.
• H. influenzae pneumonia is treated with oral amoxicillin 500 mg 3
times daily.
• Legionella pneumophila pneumonia is usually treated with one of
the macrolides, azithromycin being the drug of choice. Quinolones
are also effective and rifampicin can be added in very ill patients.
Mortality can be up to 30% in elderly patients but most patients
recover fully.
l Oxygen. All patients with hypoxaemia, acidosis and hypotension
should receive oxygen. The aim is to keep the saturation (SaO2) > 92%
and a PaO2 > 8 kPa (60 mmHg). If there is no history of COPD with
hypercapnia, 35% humidified O2 can be given. NIV (p. 485) may be
useful. Criteria for referral to ICU are given above and referral should
not be delayed.
l Fluid balance/nutritional support. Oral intake should encouraged
but, if this is not possible, then IV fluids need to be given. Nutrition
may be a problem for a longer illness and will need to be addressed
(p. 542).
Hospital-acquired pneumonia
l It is commonly treated with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g 3 times daily but meropenem 1 g 3 times daily is also used.
l Co-morbidities require more aggressive antibiotic therapy. Management is the same as for severe CAP, once appropriate samples for
culture and sensitivities have been taken.
l Gram-negative bacteria are common and aminoglycosides (e.g. gentamicin 5 mg/kg) are often added.
l Patients with chronic chest infection and others in whom Pseudomonas
infection is suspected should receive an anti-pseudomonal penicillin
(e.g. piperacillin plus tazobactam) or ciprofloxacin 200–400 mg IV over
30–60 mins or ceftazidime 2 g bolus IV 8-hourly.
l Immunosuppressed patients may require very high-dose broadspectrum antibiotics, as well as antifungal and antiviral agents.
l Aspiration pneumonia is relatively common in hospital and usually
involves infection with multiple bacteria, including anaerobes. The oral
route is usually inappropriate in these patients. A combination of metronidazole (IV or rectal) and co-amoxiclav is recommended.




QA : 




1. Q: What is the recommended antibiotic therapy for mild uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)? (Good)
   A: Mild uncomplicated CAP is typically treated in the community with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily (in the UK), or with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or doxycycline 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily (if penicillin-sensitive) for 5-7 days.


2. Q: How should more severe infections of CAP be managed? (Good)
   A: More severe infections require amoxicillin 500 mg-1 g three times daily plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. If oral therapy is contraindicated, IV amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily or benzyl penicillin 1.2 g four times daily, along with IV clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, is used. For high severity pneumonia cases, co-amoxiclav 1.2 g 6-8-hourly is combined with IV clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily.


3. Q: What additional treatment is recommended if Staphylococcus aureus infection is suspected or proven in CAP? (Good)
   A: If Staph. aureus infection is suspected or proven on culture, IV flucloxacillin 1-2 g every 6 hours by slow IV injection or infusion, with or without sodium fusidate 500 mg three times daily, should be added. Quinolones are recommended for those intolerant to penicillins or macrolides. Community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (CA-MRSA) can be treated with vancomycin or linezolid.


4. Q: How is Mycoplasma pneumonia treated? (Good)
   A: Mycoplasma pneumonia is typically treated with a macrolide, such as clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (or azithromycin) for 7-10 days, or a tetracycline, such as doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.


5. Q: What is the recommended treatment for Legionella pneumophila pneumonia? (Good)
   A: Legionella pneumophila pneumonia is usually treated with one of the macrolides, with azithromycin being the drug of choice. Quinolones are also effective, and rifampicin can be added in severe cases. Mortality can be up to 30% in elderly patients, but most patients recover fully.


6. Q: How should oxygen therapy be managed in pneumonia patients? (Good)
   A: All patients with hypoxemia, acidosis, and hypotension should receive oxygen. The aim is to keep the saturation (SaO2) above 92% and PaO2 above 8 kPa (60 mmHg). If there is no history of COPD with hypercapnia, 35% humidified O2 can be given. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be useful, and referral to the ICU should not be delayed based on specified criteria.


7. Q: What is the approach to fluid balance and nutritional support in pneumonia patients? (Not Good)
   A: Oral intake should be encouraged, but if not possible, IV fluids need to be given. Nutrition may be a problem for a longer illness and will need to be addressed.


8. Q: How is hospital-acquired pneumonia typically treated? (Good)
   A: Hospital-acquired pneumonia is commonly treated with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g three times daily or meropenem 1 g three times daily. More aggressive antibiotic therapy may be required for patients with co-morbidities, following culture and sensitivity testing.
