Growth hormone and gonadotrophins are usually the first hormones to be affected, followed by TSH and finally ACTH (panhypo- pituitarism). Prolactin levels may rise due to compression of the pituitary stalk and loss of dopaminergic inhibitory control. Clinical features Secondary hypothyroidism (p. 571) and adrenal failure (p. 582) both lead to tiredness and general malaise:  Hypothyroidism causes slowness of thought and action, dry skin and cold intolerance. Hypoadrenalism causes mild hypotension, hyponatraemia and ulti- mately cardiovascular collapse during severe intercurrent stressful illness. Gonadotrophin deficiency causes loss of libido, loss of secondary sexual hair, amenorrhoea and impotence.  Hyperprolactinaemia causes galactorrhoea and hypogonadism. Examination  Fundoscopy (with dilatation) and visual acuity testing are carried out to exclude optic atrophy, retinal vein engorgement and papilloedema associated with expansion of a tumour mass.  Visual field assessment, by formal perimetry or by confrontation using a red pin, is used to assess for optic chiasmal compression causing bitemporal hemianopia. Investigation of pituitary function  Basal serum investigations \u2022 ACTH and 09:00 h cortisol. Individuals with normal diurnal rhythm (that is not disrupted by shift work or travel across time zones) show an early morning peak of cortisol > 500 nmol/L, which excludes ACTH deficiency. Cortisol values < 100 nmol/L at 09:00 h are strongly suggestive of hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) insuf- ficiency. Levels lying between these values should be further inves- tigated by dynamic testing of the HPA axis (see below). \u2022 TSH, free T4, total T3. Low thyroid hormone values with a low TSH suggest secondary hypothyroidism. \u2022 LH, FSH, oestrogen/testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Secondary hypogonadism is suggested by low LH and FSH, despite low levels of free circulating sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone). \u2022 Prolactin. Prolactin may be high, indicating stalk compression, or low due to compression of the normal pituitary. Very high levels (typically > 5000 mU/L) indicate a prolactinoma, which is likely to respond well to medical therapy (see p. 578). \u2022 Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. IGF-1 is produced by many tissues, including the liver, muscle and kidney, in response to growth hormone and is frequently used as a surrogate indicator of growth hormone levels. However, IGF-1 levels are also influenced by factors such as nutritional status, insulin resistance and age, complicating its interpretation. \u2022 Paired serum and urine osmolality. Failure of posterior pituitary function and diabetes insipidus manifest as polyuria and raised serum osmolality.  Dynamic tests \u2022 Insulin tolerance test. 0.15 U/kg of short-acting insulin, adminis- tered intravenously to achieve a fall in plasma glucose to < 2.2mmol/L (confirmed by a laboratory measurement), initiates a classical stress response with release of cortisol and growth hormone. Glucose, cortisol and growth hormone levels are measured at baseline, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 mins. ACTH levels are also measured at baseline. A cortisol rise to > 550 nmol/L confirms an intact HPA axis; a growth hormone rise to > 20 mU/L (10 ng/L) confirms an intact growth hormone axis. The test should not be used if the 09:00 h cortisol has been shown to be < 100 nmol/L (this confirms that the patient has ACTH deficiency) or if the patient is hypothyroid. A similar response is seen after 1 mg glucagon SC. Contraindications: patients with epilepsy, unexplained losses of consciousness and ischaemic heart disease ideally should not have this test. \u2022 Short tetracosactide test. This does not directly assess pituitary reserve and is more useful for evaluating adrenal function. Where dynamic pituitary stimulation tests are impossible, it may be used as a surrogate. Injection of 250 mcg synthetic ACTH is given intrave- nously, with measurement of ACTH at baseline, and cortisol at 0, 30 and 60 mins. An increase from baseline to cortisol levels > 550 nmol/L suggests normal adrenal function. A sluggish rise at 30 mins is indic- ative of reduced pituitary function.  Imaging. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning of the pituitary is the investigation of choice, giving the most information regarding size and extension of the tumour.QA:"

        "a": "Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning is the investigation of choice for evaluating the pituitary gland in hypopituitarism, providing detailed information about the size and extension of the tumor.PASSAGE:The thyroid hormones, T4 and T3, are produced within the thyroid gland. Synthesis and release are stimulated by TSH, which is released from the pituitary gland in response to the hypothalamic factor, TRH (thyrotrophin- releasing hormone) (Fig. 15.1). Predominantly, T4 is produced, but this is converted in the peripheral tissues (liver, kidney, muscle) to the more active T3. More than 99% of T4 and T3 circulate bound to plasma proteins, mainly thyroid-binding globulin (TBG).Diagnosis of thyroid disease includes the clinical features, together with measurement of plasma TSH and thyroid hormones T4 and T3.Thyroid function testsMeasurement of plasma TSH is the single most useful assessment of thyroid function, even for the detection of mild disease. Levels will increase in response to falling levels of circulating active thyroid hor- mones and fall with high levels of thyroid hormone. Exceptions include pituitary disease and \u2018sick euthyroid syndrome\u2019, in which TSH may be low without hyperthyroidism.Measurement of plasma free T4 and free T3, along with TSH, has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests.Accurate diagnosis requires two tests, e.g.:\u2022 TSH plus free T4 or free T3 for suspected hyperthyroidism \u2022 TSH plus free T4 for hypothyroidism. Problems in interpreting thyroid function testsSerious acute or chronic illness. Failure of conversion of T4 to T3 (in favour of reverse T3) causes a reduction in hypothalamic\u2013pituitary pro- duction of TSH, resulting in low/normal measurements of all factors.Pregnancy or oral contraceptive use. Increased levels of TBG lead to higher levels of total T4 and T3. Levels of free hormone are unaffected. The TSH can be low.Heterophile antibodies. These interfere with assay measurements of hormone levels and lead to bizarre thyroid function tests that have no obvious clinical explanation. The laboratory should be able to confirm this with additional testing.Amiodarone. This prevents generation of T3 from T4, resulting in an increase in T4 levels. Tissue perception of this is of \u2018reduced\u2019 active T3 levels, and TSH levels may therefore increase. Amiodarone also provides a significant iodine load, up to 100 times the daily recommended amount. This can have two effects on thyroid function. The iodine load can:\u2022 precipitate thyrotoxicosis by unmasking subclinical hyperthyroidism in an iodine-deplete individual (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1) or\u2022 precipitate hypothyroidism due to blockade of intrathyroidal hormone production from excess iodine.Alternatively, amiodarone results in a destructive thyroiditis with the release of thyroid hormone (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosistype 2). TreatmentWhile amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is relatively straightforward to treat, with thyroxine, hyperthyroidism is more difficult. The destructive thyroiditis is best managed with prednisolone 40 mg/day, while type 1 hyperthyroidism is best managed with antithyroid drugs. In practice it can be difficult to tell the two apart and both treatments may be offered in tandem.QA:"

        "q": "What are the treatment approaches for amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism? (Good)",
        "a": "Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism can be treated with thyroxine, while the destructive thyroiditis associated with hyperthyroidism may be managed with prednisolone. Type 1 hyperthyroidism can be managed with antithyroid drugs. In some cases, both treatments may be offered simultaneously due to difficulties in distinguishing between the two conditions.PASSAGE:Primary hypothyroidism is confirmed by high levels of TSH. \u2018Compen- sated\u2019 hypothyroidism comprises a slightly raised TSH (typically < 10 mU/L) with normal levels of T4 and T3. Further failure of the thyroid gland results in increasing TSH and falling levels of T4 and T3 below thenormal range.Secondary hypothyroidism is due to pituitary\u2013hypothalamic failure;there is no increase in TSH despite falling levels of thyroid hormone.Clinical featuresHypothyroidism can produce the classic picture of a slow, dry-haired, thick-skinned, deep-voiced patient with weight gain, cold intolerance, bradycardia and constipation; however, symptoms are usually minimal and non-specific, and biochemical testing is essential in any suspected case.InvestigationsThere is raised TSH with low/normal T4 and T3.Thyroid antibodies may be positive.Additional features may include anaemia, typically normochromic nor-mocytic, but possibly either microcytic due to menorrhagia or macro-cytic due to autoimmune pernicious anaemia.There are raised serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels frommuscle and liver, raised creatine kinase (CK) levels, hypercholesterolae- mia, hyponatraemia due to increased ADH and impaired free water clearance.TreatmentThyroxine (T4) replacement is lifelong, with the aim of reducing the TSH level to the lower half of the normal range. A typical replacement dose is levothyroxine between 100 and 150 mcg per day. Starting doses range between 25 mcg and 100 mcg, depending on existing co-morbidity.Patients with heart disease benefit from slow increments of thyroxine, and adjustments to anti-anginal therapy may be required. In severe cardiac disease treatment may be initiated with a small dose of T3 (liothyronine) 2.5 mcg every 8 hours, doubling the dose every 48 hours until a maximal dose of 10 mcg 3 times daily is achieved. T4 is then commenced at this point and the T3 discontinued 5 days later.Fluctuating levels of TSH on replacement therapy typically reflect poor compliance but may result from malabsorption. Dose alterations should be reassessed after at least 6 weeks and then yearly.Myxoedema comaMyxoedema coma (rare) is profound hypothyroidism with a fall in core temperature, ECG changes (low voltage, prolonged QT interval, flat T waves and heart block), hypoglycaemia and altered mental status. General management includes maintenance of airway and bodywarmth (but not active rewarming, which risks peripheral vasodilata- tion and cardiovascular collapse), restriction of free water and glucose supplementation.IV hydrocortisone replacement 100 mg every 8 hours should be initi- ated, after blood tests have been taken for ACTH and cortisol.Thyroid hormone should be given without waiting for biochemical confirmation of hypothyroidism. There is no consensus on method of thyroid hormone replacement. Some advocate the use of 300\u2013500 mcg levothyroxine IV followed by 50\u2013100 mcg daily (either orally or IV). Others advocate a lower-dose regimen of 25 mcg levothyroxine daily, increasing on a weekly basis.Liothyronine (T3) IV may be used if there are concerns regarding impaired conversion of T4 to T3, but this risks cardiac decompensation. Doses of T3 range between 5 and 20 mcg daily. Hypothyroidism and pregnancyMaternal hypothyroidism impairs fertility and may lead to intellectual deficit in the developing child. An average increase of 50% in levothyrox- ine dose requirement is typical in pregnancy.HyperthyroidismHyperthyroidism is common and is characterized by high levels of T3 and T4 with suppression of plasma TSH. Nearly all cases are due to intrinsic thyroid disease.Clinical featuresWeight loss, increased appetite, irritability, tremor and heat intolerance are classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation is a frequent presentation, particularly in the elderly. A goitre with a bruit occurs. Apathetic thyrotoxicosis occurs in elderly patients, in whom the clinical picture is more like hypothyroidism with few clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis.Graves\u2019 disease. This autoimmune disease is the commonest form of thyrotoxicosis. In addition to symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, there may be ocular changes (exophthalmos and ophthalmoplegia), pretibial myxoedema and thyroid acropachy. Other autoimmune dis- eases, such as pernicious anaemia and myasthenia gravis, are also asso- ciated. The degree of thyrotoxicosis may fluctuate and the typical picture is of relapses and remissions. Ultimately many patients become hypothyroid.Toxic solitary nodule/toxic multinodular goitre. Although typical thy- rotoxicosis can occur, autonomy within a nodule may not cause com- plete suppression of TSH.De Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis. A transient episode of hyperthyroidism can occur with acute inflammation of the thyroid, secondary to viral infections such as mumps, Coxsackie, influenza, adenoviruses and echoviruses. Toxicosis may last for some weeks and may be followed by a period of hypothyroidism. In its acute phase it is accompanied by fever, malaise and local thyroid tenderness, and the ESR is often raised. Symptomatic treatment is with NSAIDs or aspirin, with the option of short-term prednisolone starting at 40 mg per day, reducing over 6 weeks.Treatment (Table 15.3)Propranolol is used to gain rapid control of thyrotoxic symptoms. High doses (up to 160 mg 3 times daily) may be required due to increased metabolism of the drug.There are three main options and preference varies widely.Antithyroid medications. Carbimazole initially 20 mg 3 times daily is the drug most commonly used in the UK. Its active metabolite, methi- mazole, is used preferentially in the USA. These drugs inhibit the forma- tion of thyroid hormone and the clinical benefits can take up to 2 weeks to become apparent. Propylthiouracil 300\u2013600 mg daily is occasionally used as an alternative, particularly during pregnancy and breast feeding. It has additional theoretical benefits in that it prevents periph- eral conversion of T4 to T3. The major side-effect of these medications is agranulocytosis, and prior to commencing treatment patients should be told to seek medical help should severe mouth ulcers, sore throat or febrile illness occur. A white blood cell count is then urgently required.QA:"

        "q": "What are the common causes of hyperthyroidism? (Good)",
        "a": "Nearly all cases of hyperthyroidism are due to intrinsic thyroid disease. The most common cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder. Other causes include toxic solitary nodule/toxic multinodular goiter and de Quervain's thyroiditis, which is a transient episode of hyperPASSAGE:Antithyroid medication also reduces the immune processes and thus a trial of therapy for up to 18\u201324 months may result in remission of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis. Initially doses of antithyroid medications are high. There is then the option of dose reduction as the thyroid tests normalize, or the option of adding thyroxine to high-dose anti-thyroid medication (\u2018block and replace regimen\u2019). A fall of T4 and T3 in response to treatment guides initial dose reductions (gradually reduce dose to 5 mg over 6 to 24 months if hyperthyroidism is controlled), as the TSH may remain suppressed for some time. Antithyroid medications will never lead to remission in toxic nodular disease, and while long-term antithyroid medications are an option, more definitive treatment is required.Radioactive iodine. This is increasingly accepted as a safe treatment option in the management of adults with thyrotoxicosis. It provides definitive treatment for toxic nodular disease and can be used in Graves\u2019 disease, although there are concerns that antibody levels rise following treatment and these can exacerbate dysthyroid eye disease. Patients should be made euthyroid prior to therapy but anti-thyroid medications should be discontinued at least 4 days before. A pregnancy test is per- formed in young females. Following treatment with 131iodine 200\u2013 550 MBq, patients must be monitored for a short-term \u2018flare\u2019 of thyrotoxicosis (transient hypothyroidism may also occur) and for longer-term development of hypothyroidism. The presence of a large goitre with potential for airway compromise is a contraindication. Radi- oactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation.Surgery. Subtotal thyroidectomy is performed when anti-thyroid medi- cations are not tolerated, when radioactive iodine is contraindicated, or for cosmetic reasons. All patients must be rendered euthyroid, stopping the antithyroid drugs 1\u20132 weeks before surgery and giving 60 mg of potassium iodide 3 times daily to reduce the vascularity of the gland.  Transient hypocalcaemia is relatively common following surgery due to trauma to the parathyroid glands and disruption to the blood supply. This resolves with oral or IV calcium supplementation. Long- term replacement with alfacalcidol 0.25\u20131 mcg/day is occasionally required. Damage to the recurrent nerve and permanent loss of para- thyroid gland function can occur. Function from the residual gland may be sufficient to avoid thyroid hormone replacement.Thyroid stormFever (> 38.5\u00b0C), liver dysfunction, confusion and delirium are seen in this rare disorder. Systolic hypertension and high-output cardiac failure are also present.TreatmentCorticosteroids. Hydrocortisone IV 100 mg is given since this will further inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Any precipitant cause, e.g. infection, should be treated.High-dose anti-thyroid drugs. (e.g. propylthiouracil 250 mg 8-hourly) is given.Chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine 50\u201310 mg IM is given for agitation and may help with hyperpyrexia as a result of its central action.GoitreAssessment is made of its pathological nature and the patient\u2019s thyroid status. Acute pain within a goitre suggests an acute viral thyroiditis (de Quervain\u2019s), which may be associated with transient hyperthyroidism. Pain may also herald bleeding into a cyst and is rarely associated with thyroid cancer.InvestigationsThyroid function tests and thyroid antibodies allow assessment of func- tion and diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis.Ultrasound can help monitor gland size and nature, and identify whether any nodules are cystic or solid. US does not identify malignant lesions but calcification raises the suspicion of cancer. Multiple small nodules may be demonstrated within a goitre associated with Graves\u2019 disease.Thyroid isotope scans can identify hot or cold nodules; a hot nodule reduces concerns of malignancy.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of solitary nodules or of dominant nodules within a multinodular gland helps diagnose malignancy and has replaced isotope scans and reduced the necessity for surgery. There is, however, a 5% false negative rate and follow-up is essential. TreatmentSurgery is only required in some cases:Possibility of malignancy. There may be a history of rapid growth,cervical lymphadenopathy or neck irradiation. The finding of a hard, craggy nodule should prompt referral for FNA but any dominant nodule within a gland may harbour a malignancy. Surgical resection is required if doubt persists.Local pressure symptoms. Retrosternal extension should be assessed by CT of the neck.Cosmetic reasons. If the patient is euthyroid and the goitre is small, simple reassurance may be all that is required. However, if surgery is needed, the patient is rendered euthyroid prior to it.QA:"

Pituitary tumours Pituitary tumours are a relatively common incidental finding in the general population; only a minority cause clinical problems, either due to uncon- trolled secretion of pituitary hormones, or due to local compression effects. Tumours may be small (micro-adenomas, < 10 mm diameter) or large (macro-adenomas, > 10 mm) and the vast majority are benign.  Local compression effects of a pituitary tumour include: \u2022 failure of pituitary function due to compression of normal gland \u2022 bitemporal hemianopia due to pressure on the optic chiasm \u2022 diplopia and III, IV and VI cranial nerve palsies secondary to tumour compression at the cavernous sinus \u2022 high prolactin levels due to compression of the pituitary stalk with loss of dopaminergic inhibitory control \u2022 headache \u2022 if very large, altered hypothalamic control of appetite, thirst and somnolence.  Uncontrolled hormone release occurs with tumours arising from: \u2022 corticotroph cells: Cushing\u2019s syndrome (adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) excess) \u2022 somatotroph cells: acromegaly or gigantism (growth hormone excess) \u2022 lactotroph cells: (prolactin excess) \u2022 thyrotroph cells: rarely hyperthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-releasing tumours) 565 15 Endocrine disease \u2022 gonadotroph cells: ovarian hyperstimulation and testicular enlarge- ment (rare luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) excess). Treatment The aim of therapy is to: reduce tumour bulk and relieve pressure on local structures where appropriate  restore excess hormone secretion to normal levels  eliminate associated co-morbidities and increased mortality resulting from hormone excess  preserve or restore pituitary function. radiotherapy is used if significant tumour bulk remains after surgery or the underlying disease is still active. Radiotherapy results in a gradual decline of residual pituitary function over many years and must be monitored.",

        "psg": "The hypothalamus regulates many vital functions, including appetite, thirst, thermal regulation and sleep. It controls pituitary function by stimu- latory and inhibitory factors and by hormones released via the pituitary stalk. Anterior pituitary produces hormones necessary for growth, stress response, reproduction and metabolism.  Posterior pituitary stores antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin.
