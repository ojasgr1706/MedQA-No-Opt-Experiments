The hypothalamus regulates many vital functions, including appetite, thirst, thermal regulation and sleep. It controls pituitary function by stimu- latory and inhibitory factors and by hormones released via the pituitary stalk. Anterior pituitary produces hormones necessary for growth, stress response, reproduction and metabolism.  Posterior pituitary stores antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin. Many hormones are released in either a pulsatile or a circadian pattern and are regulated by feedback systems. Endocrine tests on serum/plasma take advantage of natural peaks and troughs in secretion, while stimulatory or suppression tests are used to investigate hormone deficiency or excess further. Pituitary tumours Pituitary tumours are a relatively common incidental finding in the general population; only a minority cause clinical problems, either due to uncon- trolled secretion of pituitary hormones, or due to local compression effects. Tumours may be small (micro-adenomas, < 10 mm diameter) or large (macro-adenomas, > 10 mm) and the vast majority are benign.  Local compression effects of a pituitary tumour include: • failure of pituitary function due to compression of normal gland • bitemporal hemianopia due to pressure on the optic chiasm • diplopia and III, IV and VI cranial nerve palsies secondary to tumour compression at the cavernous sinus • high prolactin levels due to compression of the pituitary stalk with loss of dopaminergic inhibitory control • headache • if very large, altered hypothalamic control of appetite, thirst and somnolence.  Uncontrolled hormone release occurs with tumours arising from: • corticotroph cells: Cushing’s syndrome (adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) excess) • somatotroph cells: acromegaly or gigantism (growth hormone excess) • lactotroph cells: (prolactin excess) • thyrotroph cells: rarely hyperthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-releasing tumours) 565 15 Endocrine disease • gonadotroph cells: ovarian hyperstimulation and testicular enlarge- ment (rare luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) excess). Treatment The aim of therapy is to: reduce tumour bulk and relieve pressure on local structures where appropriate  restore excess hormone secretion to normal levels  eliminate associated co-morbidities and increased mortality resulting from hormone excess  preserve or restore pituitary function. radiotherapy is used if significant tumour bulk remains after surgery or the underlying disease is still active. Radiotherapy results in a gradual decline of residual pituitary function over many years and must be monitored.

PASSAGE:


Hypopituitarism Compression of the pituitary gland by a mass lesion results in progressive loss of function. Growth hormone and gonadotrophins are usually the first hormones to be affected, followed by TSH and finally ACTH (panhypo- pituitarism). Prolactin levels may rise due to compression of the pituitary stalk and loss of dopaminergic inhibitory control. Clinical features Secondary hypothyroidism (p. 571) and adrenal failure (p. 582) both lead to tiredness and general malaise:  Hypothyroidism causes slowness of thought and action, dry skin and cold intolerance. Hypoadrenalism causes mild hypotension, hyponatraemia and ulti- mately cardiovascular collapse during severe intercurrent stressful illness. Gonadotrophin deficiency causes loss of libido, loss of secondary sexual hair, amenorrhoea and impotence.  Hyperprolactinaemia causes galactorrhoea and hypogonadism. Examination  Fundoscopy (with dilatation) and visual acuity testing are carried out to exclude optic atrophy, retinal vein engorgement and papilloedema associated with expansion of a tumour mass.  Visual field assessment, by formal perimetry or by confrontation using a red pin, is used to assess for optic chiasmal compression causing bitemporal hemianopia. Investigation of pituitary function  Basal serum investigations • ACTH and 09:00 h cortisol. Individuals with normal diurnal rhythm (that is not disrupted by shift work or travel across time zones) show an early morning peak of cortisol > 500 nmol/L, which excludes ACTH deficiency. Cortisol values < 100 nmol/L at 09:00 h are strongly suggestive of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) insuf- ficiency. Levels lying between these values should be further inves- tigated by dynamic testing of the HPA axis (see below). • TSH, free T4, total T3. Low thyroid hormone values with a low TSH suggest secondary hypothyroidism. • LH, FSH, oestrogen/testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Secondary hypogonadism is suggested by low LH and FSH, despite low levels of free circulating sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone). • Prolactin. Prolactin may be high, indicating stalk compression, or low due to compression of the normal pituitary. Very high levels (typically > 5000 mU/L) indicate a prolactinoma, which is likely to respond well to medical therapy (see p. 578). • Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. IGF-1 is produced by many tissues, including the liver, muscle and kidney, in response to growth hormone and is frequently used as a surrogate indicator of growth hormone levels. However, IGF-1 levels are also influenced by factors such as nutritional status, insulin resistance and age, complicating its interpretation. • Paired serum and urine osmolality. Failure of posterior pituitary function and diabetes insipidus manifest as polyuria and raised serum osmolality.  Dynamic tests • Insulin tolerance test. 0.15 U/kg of short-acting insulin, adminis- tered intravenously to achieve a fall in plasma glucose to < 2.2mmol/L (confirmed by a laboratory measurement), initiates a classical stress response with release of cortisol and growth hormone. Glucose, cortisol and growth hormone levels are measured at baseline, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 mins. ACTH levels are also measured at baseline. A cortisol rise to > 550 nmol/L confirms an intact HPA axis; a growth hormone rise to > 20 mU/L (10 ng/L) confirms an intact growth hormone axis. The test should not be used if the 09:00 h cortisol has been shown to be < 100 nmol/L (this confirms that the patient has ACTH deficiency) or if the patient is hypothyroid. A similar response is seen after 1 mg glucagon SC. Contraindications: patients with epilepsy, unexplained losses of consciousness and ischaemic heart disease ideally should not have this test. • Short tetracosactide test. This does not directly assess pituitary reserve and is more useful for evaluating adrenal function. Where dynamic pituitary stimulation tests are impossible, it may be used as a surrogate. Injection of 250 mcg synthetic ACTH is given intrave- nously, with measurement of ACTH at baseline, and cortisol at 0, 30 and 60 mins. An increase from baseline to cortisol levels > 550 nmol/L suggests normal adrenal function. A sluggish rise at 30 mins is indic- ative of reduced pituitary function.  Imaging. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning of the pituitary is the investigation of choice, giving the most information regarding size and extension of the tumour.

7. Q: What investigations are conducted to assess pituitary function? (Good)
   A: Basal serum investigations, including ACTH and cortisol levels, TSH, free T4, total T3, LH, FSH, estrogen/testosterone, prolactin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and paired serum and urine osmolality, are conducted to assess pituitary function.


8. Q: What is the purpose of dynamic tests in investigating pituitary function? (Good)
   A: Dynamic tests are used to evaluate pituitary reserve and include the insulin tolerance test and short tetracosactide test. They help assess adrenal function and the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.


9. Q: What imaging technique is preferred for evaluating the pituitary gland in hypopituitarism? (Good)
   A: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning is the investigation of choice for evaluating the pituitary gland in hypopituitarism, providing detailed information about the size and extension of the tumor.








PASSAGE:
The thyroid hormones, T4 and T3, are produced within the thyroid gland. Synthesis and release are stimulated by TSH, which is released from the pituitary gland in response to the hypothalamic factor, TRH (thyrotrophin- releasing hormone) (Fig. 15.1). Predominantly, T4 is produced, but this is converted in the peripheral tissues (liver, kidney, muscle) to the more active T3. More than 99% of T4 and T3 circulate bound to plasma proteins, mainly thyroid-binding globulin (TBG).
Diagnosis of thyroid disease includes the clinical features, together with measurement of plasma TSH and thyroid hormones T4 and T3.
Thyroid function tests
Measurement of plasma TSH is the single most useful assessment of thyroid function, even for the detection of mild disease. Levels will increase in response to falling levels of circulating active thyroid hor- mones and fall with high levels of thyroid hormone. Exceptions include pituitary disease and ‘sick euthyroid syndrome’, in which TSH may be low without hyperthyroidism.
Measurement of plasma free T4 and free T3, along with TSH, has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests.
Accurate diagnosis requires two tests, e.g.:
• TSH plus free T4 or free T3 for suspected hyperthyroidism • TSH plus free T4 for hypothyroidism. Problems in interpreting thyroid function tests
Serious acute or chronic illness. Failure of conversion of T4 to T3 (in favour of reverse T3) causes a reduction in hypothalamic–pituitary pro- duction of TSH, resulting in low/normal measurements of all factors.
Pregnancy or oral contraceptive use. Increased levels of TBG lead to higher levels of total T4 and T3. Levels of free hormone are unaffected. The TSH can be low.
Heterophile antibodies. These interfere with assay measurements of hormone levels and lead to bizarre thyroid function tests that have no obvious clinical explanation. The laboratory should be able to confirm this with additional testing.
Amiodarone. This prevents generation of T3 from T4, resulting in an increase in T4 levels. Tissue perception of this is of ‘reduced’ active T3 levels, and TSH levels may therefore increase. Amiodarone also provides a significant iodine load, up to 100 times the daily recommended amount. This can have two effects on thyroid function. The iodine load can:
• precipitate thyrotoxicosis by unmasking subclinical hyperthyroidism in an iodine-deplete individual (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1) or
• precipitate hypothyroidism due to blockade of intrathyroidal hormone production from excess iodine.
Alternatively, amiodarone results in a destructive thyroiditis with the release of thyroid hormone (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis
type 2). Treatment
While amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is relatively straightforward to treat, with thyroxine, hyperthyroidism is more difficult. The destructive thyroiditis is best managed with prednisolone 40 mg/day, while type 1 hyperthyroidism is best managed with antithyroid drugs. In practice it can be difficult to tell the two apart and both treatments may be offered in tandem.




QA:


1. Q: How are thyroid hormones T4 and T3 produced? (Good)
   A: Thyroid hormones T4 and T3 are produced within the thyroid gland. TSH, released from the pituitary gland in response to TRH (thyrotrophin-releasing hormone) from the hypothalamus, stimulates their synthesis and release.


2. Q: What is the role of plasma TSH in assessing thyroid function? (Good)
   A: Measurement of plasma TSH is the most useful assessment of thyroid function. TSH levels increase when circulating active thyroid hormone levels decrease and fall when thyroid hormone levels are high.


3. Q: How can plasma TSH, free T4, and free T3 help in diagnosing thyroid disease? (Good)
   A: Measurement of plasma TSH, along with free T4 and free T3, simplifies the interpretation of thyroid function tests. Two tests are typically used for diagnosis: TSH plus free T4 or free T3 for suspected hyperthyroidism and TSH plus free T4 for hypothyroidism.


4. Q: What are some challenges in interpreting thyroid function tests? (Good)
   A: Challenges in interpreting thyroid function tests include serious acute or chronic illness, pregnancy or oral contraceptive use (which affect levels of total T4 and T3 but not free hormone levels), heterophile antibodies interfering with assay measurements, and the use of amiodarone, which can affect T4-to-T3 conversion and iodine levels.


5. Q: How does amiodarone affect thyroid function? (Good)
   A: Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication, can affect thyroid function in various ways. It can prevent the conversion of T4 to T3, increase T4 levels while reducing tissue perception of active T3 levels, and provide a significant iodine load, which can lead to either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism.


6. Q: What are the treatment approaches for amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism? (Good)
   A: Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism can be treated with thyroxine, while the destructive thyroiditis associated with hyperthyroidism may be managed with prednisolone. Type 1 hyperthyroidism can be managed with antithyroid drugs. In some cases, both treatments may be offered simultaneously due to difficulties in distinguishing between the two conditions.








PASSAGE:
 Primary hypothyroidism is confirmed by high levels of TSH. ‘Compen- sated’ hypothyroidism comprises a slightly raised TSH (typically < 10 mU/L) with normal levels of T4 and T3. Further failure of the thyroid gland results in increasing TSH and falling levels of T4 and T3 below the
normal range.
Secondary hypothyroidism is due to pituitary–hypothalamic failure;
there is no increase in TSH despite falling levels of thyroid hormone.
Clinical features
Hypothyroidism can produce the classic picture of a slow, dry-haired, thick-skinned, deep-voiced patient with weight gain, cold intolerance, bradycardia and constipation; however, symptoms are usually minimal and non-specific, and biochemical testing is essential in any suspected case.
Investigations
There is raised TSH with low/normal T4 and T3.
Thyroid antibodies may be positive.
Additional features may include anaemia, typically normochromic nor-
mocytic, but possibly either microcytic due to menorrhagia or macro-
cytic due to autoimmune pernicious anaemia.
There are raised serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels from
muscle and liver, raised creatine kinase (CK) levels, hypercholesterolae- mia, hyponatraemia due to increased ADH and impaired free water clearance.
Treatment
Thyroxine (T4) replacement is lifelong, with the aim of reducing the TSH level to the lower half of the normal range. A typical replacement dose is levothyroxine between 100 and 150 mcg per day. Starting doses range between 25 mcg and 100 mcg, depending on existing co-morbidity.
Patients with heart disease benefit from slow increments of thyroxine, and adjustments to anti-anginal therapy may be required. In severe cardiac disease treatment may be initiated with a small dose of T3 (liothyronine) 2.5 mcg every 8 hours, doubling the dose every 48 hours until a maximal dose of 10 mcg 3 times daily is achieved. T4 is then commenced at this point and the T3 discontinued 5 days later.
Fluctuating levels of TSH on replacement therapy typically reflect poor compliance but may result from malabsorption. Dose alterations should be reassessed after at least 6 weeks and then yearly.
Myxoedema coma
Myxoedema coma (rare) is profound hypothyroidism with a fall in core temperature, ECG changes (low voltage, prolonged QT interval, flat T waves and heart block), hypoglycaemia and altered mental status. General management includes maintenance of airway and body
warmth (but not active rewarming, which risks peripheral vasodilata- tion and cardiovascular collapse), restriction of free water and glucose supplementation.
IV hydrocortisone replacement 100 mg every 8 hours should be initi- ated, after blood tests have been taken for ACTH and cortisol.
Thyroid hormone should be given without waiting for biochemical confirmation of hypothyroidism. There is no consensus on method of thyroid hormone replacement. Some advocate the use of 300–500 mcg levothyroxine IV followed by 50–100 mcg daily (either orally or IV). Others advocate a lower-dose regimen of 25 mcg levothyroxine daily, increasing on a weekly basis.
Liothyronine (T3) IV may be used if there are concerns regarding impaired conversion of T4 to T3, but this risks cardiac decompensation. Doses of T3 range between 5 and 20 mcg daily. Hypothyroidism and pregnancy
Maternal hypothyroidism impairs fertility and may lead to intellectual deficit in the developing child. An average increase of 50% in levothyrox- ine dose requirement is typical in pregnancy.
Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism is common and is characterized by high levels of T3 and T4 with suppression of plasma TSH. Nearly all cases are due to intrinsic thyroid disease.
Clinical features
Weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, tremor and heat intolerance are classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation is a frequent presentation, particularly in the elderly. A goitre with a bruit occurs. Apathetic thyrotoxicosis occurs in elderly patients, in whom the clinical picture is more like hypothyroidism with few clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis.
Graves’ disease. This autoimmune disease is the commonest form of thyrotoxicosis. In addition to symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, there may be ocular changes (exophthalmos and ophthalmoplegia), pretibial myxoedema and thyroid acropachy. Other autoimmune dis- eases, such as pernicious anaemia and myasthenia gravis, are also asso- ciated. The degree of thyrotoxicosis may fluctuate and the typical picture is of relapses and remissions. Ultimately many patients become hypothyroid.
Toxic solitary nodule/toxic multinodular goitre. Although typical thy- rotoxicosis can occur, autonomy within a nodule may not cause com- plete suppression of TSH.
De Quervain’s thyroiditis. A transient episode of hyperthyroidism can occur with acute inflammation of the thyroid, secondary to viral infections such as mumps, Coxsackie, influenza, adenoviruses and echoviruses. Toxicosis may last for some weeks and may be followed by a period of hypothyroidism. In its acute phase it is accompanied by fever, malaise and local thyroid tenderness, and the ESR is often raised. Symptomatic treatment is with NSAIDs or aspirin, with the option of short-term prednisolone starting at 40 mg per day, reducing over 6 weeks.
Treatment (Table 15.3)
Propranolol is used to gain rapid control of thyrotoxic symptoms. High doses (up to 160 mg 3 times daily) may be required due to increased metabolism of the drug.
There are three main options and preference varies widely.
Antithyroid medications. Carbimazole initially 20 mg 3 times daily is the drug most commonly used in the UK. Its active metabolite, methi- mazole, is used preferentially in the USA. These drugs inhibit the forma- tion of thyroid hormone and the clinical benefits can take up to 2 weeks to become apparent. Propylthiouracil 300–600 mg daily is occasionally used as an alternative, particularly during pregnancy and breast feeding. It has additional theoretical benefits in that it prevents periph- eral conversion of T4 to T3. The major side-effect of these medications is agranulocytosis, and prior to commencing treatment patients should be told to seek medical help should severe mouth ulcers, sore throat or febrile illness occur. A white blood cell count is then urgently required.




QA:
1. Q: How is primary hypothyroidism diagnosed? (Good)
   A: Primary hypothyroidism is confirmed by high levels of TSH. In compensated hypothyroidism, TSH levels are slightly raised (< 10 mU/L), while T4 and T3 levels remain normal. Further failure of the thyroid gland leads to increasing TSH levels and falling levels of T4 and T3 below the normal range.


2. Q: What are the clinical features of hypothyroidism? (Good)
   A: Clinical features of hypothyroidism can include a slow metabolism, dry hair, thickened skin, deep voice, weight gain, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and constipation. However, symptoms are often minimal and non-specific, and biochemical testing is essential for diagnosis.


3. Q: What investigations are done for hypothyroidism? (Good)
   A: Investigations for hypothyroidism include measuring TSH, which is high, along with low/normal levels of T4 and T3. Thyroid antibodies may be positive. Additional features can include anemia, elevated AST and CK levels, hypercholesterolemia, and hyponatremia.


4. Q: What is the treatment for hypothyroidism? (Good)
   A: The treatment for hypothyroidism is lifelong thyroid hormone replacement with thyroxine (T4). The goal is to reduce TSH levels to the lower half of the normal range. The typical replacement dose is levothyroxine between 100 and 150 mcg per day, but the initial dose may vary depending on existing co-morbidities. Slow increments of thyroxine are recommended for patients with heart disease. In severe cardiac disease, a small dose of T3 (liothyronine) may be initiated before starting T4. Dose adjustments should be reassessed after at least 6 weeks and then yearly.


5. Q: What is myxoedema coma, and how is it managed? (Good)
   A: Myxoedema coma is a rare and profound form of hypothyroidism. It is characterized by a fall in core temperature, ECG changes, hypoglycemia, and altered mental status. General management includes airway maintenance, body warmth maintenance (without active rewarming), restriction of free water, and glucose supplementation. IV hydrocortisone replacement is initiated, and thyroid hormone replacement should be given without waiting for biochemical confirmation. The optimal method of thyroid hormone replacement is still debated.


6. Q: How does maternal hypothyroidism affect pregnancy, and how is it managed? (Good)
   A: Maternal hypothyroidism can impair fertility and may lead to intellectual deficits in the developing child. During pregnancy, the average levothyroxine dose requirement increases by approximately 50%. Regular monitoring and adjustment of thyroid hormone replacement are essential during pregnancy to maintain adequate thyroid function.


7. Q: What are the clinical features of hyperthyroidism? (Good)
   A: Clinical features of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, tremor, heat intolerance, and tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation can also occur, particularly in the elderly. A goiter with a bruit may be present. In some cases, elderly patients may present with apathetic thyrotoxicosis, resembling hypothyroidism with few signs of hyperthyroidism.


8. Q: What are the common causes of hyperthyroidism? (Good)
   A: Nearly all cases of hyperthyroidism are due to intrinsic thyroid disease. The most common cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder. Other causes include toxic solitary nodule/toxic multinodular goiter and de Quervain's thyroiditis, which is a transient episode of hyper






PASSAGE:


Antithyroid medication also reduces the immune processes and thus a trial of therapy for up to 18–24 months may result in remission of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis. Initially doses of antithyroid medications are high. There is then the option of dose reduction as the thyroid tests normalize, or the option of adding thyroxine to high-dose anti-thyroid medication (‘block and replace regimen’). A fall of T4 and T3 in response to treatment guides initial dose reductions (gradually reduce dose to 5 mg over 6 to 24 months if hyperthyroidism is controlled), as the TSH may remain suppressed for some time. Antithyroid medications will never lead to remission in toxic nodular disease, and while long-term antithyroid medications are an option, more definitive treatment is required.
Radioactive iodine. This is increasingly accepted as a safe treatment option in the management of adults with thyrotoxicosis. It provides definitive treatment for toxic nodular disease and can be used in Graves’ disease, although there are concerns that antibody levels rise following treatment and these can exacerbate dysthyroid eye disease. Patients should be made euthyroid prior to therapy but anti-thyroid medications should be discontinued at least 4 days before. A pregnancy test is per- formed in young females. Following treatment with 131iodine 200– 550 MBq, patients must be monitored for a short-term ‘flare’ of thyrotoxicosis (transient hypothyroidism may also occur) and for longer-term development of hypothyroidism. The presence of a large goitre with potential for airway compromise is a contraindication. Radi- oactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation.
Surgery. Subtotal thyroidectomy is performed when anti-thyroid medi- cations are not tolerated, when radioactive iodine is contraindicated, or for cosmetic reasons. All patients must be rendered euthyroid, stopping the antithyroid drugs 1–2 weeks before surgery and giving 60 mg of potassium iodide 3 times daily to reduce the vascularity of the gland.  Transient hypocalcaemia is relatively common following surgery due to trauma to the parathyroid glands and disruption to the blood supply. This resolves with oral or IV calcium supplementation. Long- term replacement with alfacalcidol 0.25–1 mcg/day is occasionally required. Damage to the recurrent nerve and permanent loss of para- thyroid gland function can occur. Function from the residual gland may be sufficient to avoid thyroid hormone replacement.
Thyroid storm
Fever (> 38.5°C), liver dysfunction, confusion and delirium are seen in this rare disorder. Systolic hypertension and high-output cardiac failure are also present.
Treatment
Corticosteroids. Hydrocortisone IV 100 mg is given since this will further inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Any precipitant cause, e.g. infection, should be treated.
High-dose anti-thyroid drugs. (e.g. propylthiouracil 250 mg 8-hourly) is given.
Chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine 50–10 mg IM is given for agitation and may help with hyperpyrexia as a result of its central action.
Goitre
Assessment is made of its pathological nature and the patient’s thyroid status. Acute pain within a goitre suggests an acute viral thyroiditis (de Quervain’s), which may be associated with transient hyperthyroidism. Pain may also herald bleeding into a cyst and is rarely associated with thyroid cancer.
Investigations
Thyroid function tests and thyroid antibodies allow assessment of func- tion and diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis.
Ultrasound can help monitor gland size and nature, and identify whether any nodules are cystic or solid. US does not identify malignant lesions but calcification raises the suspicion of cancer. Multiple small nodules may be demonstrated within a goitre associated with Graves’ disease.
Thyroid isotope scans can identify hot or cold nodules; a hot nodule reduces concerns of malignancy.
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of solitary nodules or of dominant nodules within a multinodular gland helps diagnose malignancy and has replaced isotope scans and reduced the necessity for surgery. There is, however, a 5% false negative rate and follow-up is essential. Treatment
Surgery is only required in some cases:
Possibility of malignancy. There may be a history of rapid growth,
cervical lymphadenopathy or neck irradiation. The finding of a hard, craggy nodule should prompt referral for FNA but any dominant nodule within a gland may harbour a malignancy. Surgical resection is required if doubt persists.
Local pressure symptoms. Retrosternal extension should be assessed by CT of the neck.
Cosmetic reasons. If the patient is euthyroid and the goitre is small, simple reassurance may be all that is required. However, if surgery is needed, the patient is rendered euthyroid prior to it.


QA:




1. Q: How long is a trial of antithyroid therapy recommended for autoimmune thyrotoxicosis? (Good)
   A: A trial of therapy for up to 18-24 months is recommended.


2. Q: What are the options for dose reduction in antithyroid medication? (Good)
   A: The options for dose reduction include gradual reduction as thyroid tests normalize or adding thyroxine to high-dose anti-thyroid medication in a "block and replace regimen."


3. Q: How does the response of T4 and T3 levels guide initial dose reductions in antithyroid medication? (Good)
   A: A fall of T4 and T3 levels in response to treatment guides initial dose reductions. The dose is gradually reduced over 6 to 24 months if hyperthyroidism is controlled.


4. Q: Can antithyroid medications lead to remission in toxic nodular disease? (Good)
   A: No, antithyroid medications will never lead to remission in toxic nodular disease. More definitive treatment is required in such cases.


5. Q: What is the preferred treatment option for adults with thyrotoxicosis? (Good)
   A: Radioactive iodine is increasingly accepted as a safe treatment option for adults with thyrotoxicosis.


6. Q: What should be done before administering radioactive iodine therapy? (Good)
   A: Patients should be made euthyroid (normal thyroid function) prior to therapy, and anti-thyroid medications should be discontinued at least 4 days before treatment. A pregnancy test is performed in young females.


7. Q: What are the potential complications of surgery for thyrotoxicosis? (Good)
   A: Transient hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) is relatively common following surgery, and it can be resolved with oral or IV calcium supplementation. Damage to the recurrent nerve and permanent loss of parathyroid gland function can also occur.


8. Q: What symptoms are associated with thyroid storm? (Good)
