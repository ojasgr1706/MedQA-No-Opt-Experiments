ree Compartments of the Mediastinum 
■  MEDIASTINAL MASSES The first step in evaluating a mediastinal mass is to place it in one of the three mediastinal compartments, since each has different characteristic lesions ( Table 295-1 ). 
Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the most valuable 
imaging technique for evaluating mediastinal masses and is the only imaging technique that should be done in most instances. Barium studies of the gastrointestinal tract are indicated in many patients with posterior mediastinal lesions, becauseg hernias, diverticula, and achalasia are readily diagnosed in this manner. An iodine-131 scan can efficiently establish the diagnosis of intrathoracic goiter. 
A definite diagnosis can be obtained with mediastinoscopy or 
anterior mediastinotomy in many patients with masses in the anterior or middle mediastinal compartments. A diagnosis can be established without thoracotomy via percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy or endoscopic transesophageal or endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of mediastinal masses in most cases. An alternative way to establish the diagnosis is video-assisted thoracoscopy. In many cases, the diagnosis can be established and the mediastinal mass removed with video-assisted thoracoscopy. 
■  ACUTE MEDIASTINITIS Cases of acute mediastinitis are usually due to esophageal perforation, occur after median sternotomy for cardiac surgery, or are infections descending from the neck, oral cavity, or facial area. Patients with esophageal rupture are acutely ill with chest pain and dyspnea due to the mediastinal infection. The esophageal rupture can occur spontaneously or as a complication of esophagoscopy or the insertion of a Blakemore tube. Appropriate treatment consists of exploration of the mediastinum with primary repair of the esophageal tear and drainage of the pleural space and the mediastinum. 
The incidence of mediastinitis after median sternotomy is 0.4– 
5.0%. Patients most commonly present with wound drainage. Other presentations include sepsis and a widened mediastinum. The diagnosis usually is established with mediastinal needle aspiration. Treatment includes immediate drainage, debridement, and parenteral antibiotic therapy, but the mortality rate still exceeds 20%. 
■  CHRONIC MEDIASTINITIS 
The spectrum of chronic mediastinitis ranges from granulomatous inflammation of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum to fibrosing mediastinitis. Most cases are due to histoplasmosis or tuberculosis, but sarcoidosis, silicosis, and other fungal diseases are at times causative. Patients with granulomatous mediastinitis are usually asymptomatic. Those with fibrosing mediastinitis usually have signs of compression of a mediastinal structure such as the superior vena cava or large airways, phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, or obstruction of the pulmonary artery or proximal pulmonary veins. If veins or arteries are involved, the placement of stents has relieved the symptoms in many patients. 
■  PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM In this condition, there is gas in the interstices of the mediastinum. The three main causes are (1) alveolar rupture with dissection of air into the mediastinum; (2) perforation or rupture of the esophagus, trachea, or main bronchi; and (3) dissection of air from the neck or the abdomen into the mediastinum. Typically, there is severe substernal chest pain with or without radiation into the neck and arms. The physical examination usually reveals subcutaneous emphysema in the suprasternal notch and  Hamman’s sign , which is a crunching or clicking noise synchronous with the heartbeat and is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position. The diagnosis is confirmed with the chest radiograph. Usually no treatment is required, but the mediastinal air will be absorbed faster if the patient inspires high concentrations of oxygen. If mediastinal structures are compressed, the compression can be relieved with needle aspiration.

In health, the arterial level of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is maintained between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. All disorders of ventilation result in abnormal measurements of PaCO2. This chapter reviews chronic ventilatory disorders. 
The continuous production of carbon dioxide (CO2) by cellular 
metabolism necessitates its efficient elimination by the respiratory system. The relationship between CO2 production and PaCO2 is described by the equation: PaCO2 = (k) (V ̇ CO2)/V ̇   A, where V ̇ CO2represents the carbon dioxide production, k is a constant, and V ̇   A is fresh gas alveolar ventilation  ( Chap. 285 ) . V ̇   A can be calculated as minute ventilation × (1 – Vd/Vt), where the dead space fraction Vd/Vt represents the portion of a tidal breath that remains within the conducting airways at the conclusion of inspiration and so does not contribute to alveolar ventilation. As such, all disturbances of PaCO2must reflect altered CO2 production, minute ventilation, or dead space fraction. 
Diseases that alter (V ̇ CO2) are often acute (e.g., sepsis, burns, or 
pyrexia), and their contribution to ventilatory abnormalities and/or respiratory failure is reviewed elsewhere. Chronic ventilatory disorders typically involve inappropriate levels of minute ventilation or increased dead space fraction. Characterization of these disorders requires a review of the normal respiratory cycle. 
The spontaneous cycle of inspiration and expiration is 
automatically generated in the brainstem. Two groups of neurons located within the medulla are particularly important: the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) and the ventral respiratory column (VRC). These neurons have widespread projections including the descending projections into the contralateral spinal cord where they 
perform many functions. They initiate activity in the phrenic nerve/diaphragm, project to the upper airway muscle groups and spinal respiratory neurons, and innervate the intercostal and abdominal muscles that participate in normal respiration. The DRG acts as the initial integration site for many of the afferent nerves relaying information about PaO2, PaCO2, pH, and blood pressure from the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors and baroreceptors to the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, the vagus nerve relays information from stretch receptors and juxtapulmonary-capillary receptors in the lung parenchyma and chest wall to the DRG. The respiratory rhythm is generated within the VRC as well as the more rostrally located parafacial respiratory group (pFRG), which is particularly important for the generation of active expiration. One particularly important area within the VRC is the so-called pre- Bötzinger complex. This area is responsible for the generation of various forms of inspiratory activity, and lesioning of the pre- Bötzinger complex leads to the complete cessation of breathing. The neural output of these medullary respiratory networks can be voluntarily suppressed or augmented by input from higher brain centers and the autonomic nervous system. During normal sleep, there is an attenuated response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, resulting in mild nocturnal hypoventilation that corrects upon awakening. 
Once neural input has been delivered to the respiratory pump 
muscles, normal gas exchange requires an adequate amount of respiratory muscle strength to overcome the elastic and resistive loads of the respiratory system  ( Fig. 296-1 A ) (also see  Chap. 285 ) . In health, the strength of the respiratory muscles readily accomplishes this, and normal respiration continues indefinitely. Reduction in respiratory drive or neuromuscular competence or substantial increase in respiratory load can diminish minute ventilation, resulting in hypercapnia  ( Fig. 296-1 B ) . Alternatively, if normal respiratory muscle strength is coupled with excessive respiratory drive, then alveolar hyperventilation ensues and leads to hypocapnia  ( Fig. 296-1 C ) . 
load. A.  Excess respiratory muscle strength in health.  B.  Load greater than strength.  C.  Increased drive with acceptable strength. 
 CLINICAL FEATURES Diseases that reduce minute ventilation or increase dead space fall into four major categories: parenchymal lung and chest wall disease, sleep-disordered breathing, neuromuscular disease, and respiratory drive disorders ( Fig. 296-1 B ). The clinical manifestations of hypoventilation syndromes are nonspecific  ( Table 296-1 )  and vary depending on the severity of hypoventilation, the rate at which hypercapnia develops, the degree of compensation for respiratory acidosis, and the underlying disorder. Patients with parenchymal lung or chest wall disease typically present with shortness of breath and diminished exercise tolerance. Episodes of increased dyspnea and sputum production are hallmarks of obstructive lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas progressive dyspnea and cough are common in interstitial lung diseases. Excessive daytime somnolence, poor-quality sleep, and snoring are common among patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep disturbance and orthopnea are also described in 
neuromuscular disorders. As neuromuscular weakness progresses, the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, are placed at a mechanical disadvantage in the supine position due to the upward movement of the abdominal contents. New-onset orthopnea is frequently a sign of reduced respiratory muscle force generation. More commonly, however, extremity weakness or bulbar symptoms develop prior to sleep disturbance in neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or muscular dystrophy. Patients with respiratory drive disorders do not have symptoms distinguishable from other causes of chronic hypoventilation. 
TABLE 296-1 Signs and Symptoms of Hypoventilation 
The clinical course of patients with chronic hypoventilation from 
neuromuscular or chest wall disease follows a characteristic sequence: an asymptomatic stage where daytime PaO2 and PaCO2are normal followed by nocturnal hypoventilation, initially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and later in non-REM sleep. Finally, if vital capacity drops further, daytime hypercapnia develops. Symptoms can develop at any point along this time course and often depend on the pace of respiratory muscle functional decline. Regardless of cause, the hallmark of all alveolar hypoventilation syndromes is an increase in alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) and therefore in PaCO2. The resulting respiratory acidosis eventually leads to a compensatory increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration. The increase in PaCO2 results in an obligatory decrease in PAO2, often resulting in hypoxemia. If severe, the hypoxemia manifests clinically as cyanosis and can stimulate erythropoiesis and thus induce secondary erythrocytosis. The combination of chronic hypoxemia 
and hypercapnia may also induce pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading eventually to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right heart failure. 
■  DIAGNOSIS Elevated serum bicarbonate (i.e., total serum CO2, which equals calculated bicarbonate plus dissolved CO2) in the absence of volume depletion is suggestive of hypoventilation. However, it is important to point out that a serum bicarbonate level <27 mmol/L in the setting of normal renal function makes the diagnosis of hypoventilation very unlikely. By contrast, a serum bicarbonate level ≥27 mmol/L should trigger clinicians to measure PaCO2 as a confirmatory diagnostic test. Therefore, serum bicarbonate can be used as a sensitive test to rule out hypercapnia, not to rule it in. An arterial blood gas demonstrating elevated PaCO2 with a normal pH confirms chronic alveolar hypoventilation. The subsequent evaluation to identify an etiology should initially focus on whether the patient has lung disease or chest wall abnormalities. Physical examination, imaging studies (chest x-ray and/or CT scan), and pulmonary function tests are sufficient to identify most lung/chest wall disorders leading to hypercapnia. If these evaluations are unrevealing, the clinician should screen for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), the most frequent sleep disorder leading to chronic hypoventilation, which is typically accompanied by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Several screening tools have been developed to identify patients at risk for OSA. The Berlin Questionnaire has been validated in a primary care setting and identifies patients likely to have OSA. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) measures daytime sleepiness, with a score of ≥10 identifying individuals who warrant additional investigation; however, it is not a useful test to screen for sleep-disordered breathing. Owing to its ease of use, the STOP-Bang questionnaire has become a popular tool to screen for OSA and has been validated in various outpatient settings. The STOP-Bang survey has been used in preoperative anesthesia clinics to identify patients at risk of having OSA. In this population, it has 93% sensitivity and 90% negative predictive value. Additionally, the STOP-Bang questionnaire 
has been validated as a screening tool for OSA in sleep and surgical clinics. The probability of moderate and severe OSA steadily increases with higher STOP-Bang scores. 
If the ventilatory apparatus (lung, airways, chest wall) is not 
responsible for chronic hypercapnia, then the focus should shift to respiratory drive and neuromuscular disorders. There is an attenuated increase in minute ventilation in response to elevated CO2 and/or low O2 in respiratory drive disorders. These diseases are difficult to diagnose and should be suspected when patients with hypercapnia are found to have normal respiratory muscle strength, normal pulmonary function, and normal alveolar-arterial PO2difference. Hypoventilation is more marked during sleep in patients with respiratory drive defects, and polysomnography often reveals central apneas, hypopneas, or hypoventilation. Brain imaging (CT scan or MRI) can sometimes identify structural abnormalities in the pons or medulla that result in hypoventilation. Chronic narcotic use or significant hypothyroidism can depress the central respiratory drive and lead to chronic hypercapnia as well. 
Respiratory muscle weakness has to be profound before lung 
volumes are compromised and hypercapnia develops. Typically, physical examination reveals decreased strength in major muscle groups prior to the development of hypercapnia. Measurement of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures or forced vital capacity (FVC) can be used to monitor for respiratory muscle involvement in diseases with progressive muscle weakness. These patients also have increased risk for sleep-disordered breathing, including hypopneas, central and obstructive apneas, and hypoxemia. Nighttime oximetry and capnometry during polysomnography are helpful in better characterizing sleep disturbances in this patient population. 
TREATMENT 
Nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been used successfully in the treatment of hypoventilation and apneas, both central and obstructive, in patients with 
neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. Nocturnal NIPPV has been shown to improve daytime hypercapnia, prolong survival, and improve health-related quality of life when daytime hypercapnia is documented. ALS guidelines recommend consideration of nocturnal NIPPV if symptoms of hypoventilation exist and one of the following criteria is present: PaCO2 ≥45 mmHg; nocturnal oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤88% for 5 consecutive min; maximal inspiratory pressure <60 cmH2O; or sniff nasal pressure <40 cmH2O and FVC <50% predicted. However, at present, there is inconclusive evidence to support preemptive nocturnal NIPPV use in all patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disorders who demonstrate nocturnal but not daytime hypercapnia. Nevertheless, at some point, the institution of full-time ventilatory support with either pressure or volume-preset modes is required in progressive neuromuscular disorders. There is less evidence to direct the timing of this decision, but ventilatory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and chest infections related to ineffective cough are frequent triggers for the institution of full-time ventilatory support. 
Treatment of chronic hypoventilation from lung or neuromuscular 
diseases should be directed at the underlying disorder. Pharmacologic agents that stimulate respiration, such as medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide, have been poorly studied in chronic hypoventilation and should not replace treatment of the underlying disease process. Regardless of the cause, excessive metabolic alkalosis should be corrected, as serum bicarbonate levels elevated out of proportion for the degree of chronic respiratory acidosis can result in additional hypoventilation. When indicated, administration of supplemental oxygen is effective in attenuating hypoxemia, polycythemia, and pulmonary hypertension. However, in some patients, supplemental oxygen, even at low concentrations, can worsen hypercapnia. 
Phrenic nerve or diaphragm pacing is a potential therapy for 
patients with hypoventilation from high cervical spinal cord lesions or respiratory drive disorders. Prior to surgical implantation, patients should have nerve conduction studies to ensure normal bilateral phrenic nerve function. Small case series suggest that effective diaphragmatic pacing can improve quality of life in these patients. 
■  OBESITY HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME The diagnosis of OHS requires the following: body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2; chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation, defined as PaCO2 ≥45 mmHg at sea level in the absence of other known causes of hypercapnia; and evidence of sleep-disordered breathing. In almost 90% of cases, the sleep-disordered breathing is in the form of OSA, with close to 70% exhibiting severe OSA. Several international studies in different populations confirm that the overall prevalence of OSA syndrome, defined by an apnea-hypopnea index ≥5  and daytime sleepiness, is  ∼ 14% in men and 5% in women aged 30–70 years in the United States. Thus, the population at risk for the development of OHS continues to rise as the worldwide obesity epidemic persists. Although no population-based prevalence studies of OHS have been performed, some estimates suggest it may be as high as 0.4% of the U.S. adult population (or 1 in 263 adults). 
Some, but not all, studies suggest that severe obesity (BMI >40 
kg/m2) and severe OSA (AHI >30 events per h) are risk factors for the development of OHS. The pathogenesis of hypoventilation in these patients is the result of multiple physiologic variables and conditions including OSA, increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle impairment relative to the increased load because of excess adiposity, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and depressed central ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. These defects in central respiratory drive often improve with treatment of sleep-disordered breathing with CPAP or NIPPV without any significant change in body weight, which suggests that decreased ventilatory responsiveness is a consequence rather than a primary cause of OHS. The treatment of OHS is similar to that for OSA: weight reduction and positive airway pressure therapy during sleep with either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or NIPPV. There is evidence that substantial weight loss (i.e., 20–25% of actual body weight) alone normalizes PaCO2 in patients with OHS. Unfortunately, achieving and sustaining this degree of weight loss 
without bariatric surgery are very challenging for most patients. Treatment with CPAP or NIPPV should not be delayed while the patient attempts to lose weight. CPAP improves daytime hypercapnia and hypoxemia in more than half of patients with OHS and concomitant severe OSA. Bilevel positive airway pressure without a backup rate (bilevel PAP spontaneous mode) should be reserved for patients not able to tolerate high levels of CPAP support or when obstructive respiratory events persist despite reaching the maximum CPAP pressure of 20 cmH2O. NIPPV in the form of bilevel PAP with a backup rate (bilevel PAP ST or spontaneous timed) or volume-assured pressure support modes should be strongly considered if hypercapnia persists after several weeks of CPAP therapy with objectively proven adherence. Patients with OHS and no evidence of significant OSA are typically started on bilevel PAP ST or volume-assured pressure support modes, as are patients presenting with acute decompensated OHS. Finally, comorbid conditions that impair ventilation, such as COPD, should be aggressively treated in conjunction with coexisting OHS. 
■  CENTRAL HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME This syndrome can present later in life or in the neonatal period, when it is often called Ondine’s curse or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Abnormalities in the gene encoding PHOX2b, a transcription factor with a role in neuronal development, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CCHS. Regardless of the age of onset, these patients have absent respiratory response to hypoxia or hypercapnia, mildly elevated PaCO2 while awake, and markedly elevated PaCO2 during non-REM sleep. Interestingly, these patients are able to augment their ventilation and “normalize” PaCO2 during exercise and during REM sleep. These patients typically require NIPPV or mechanical ventilation as therapy and should be considered for phrenic nerve or diaphragmatic pacing at centers with experience performing these procedures. 
■  CLINICAL FEATURES Hyperventilation is defined as ventilation in excess of metabolic requirements (CO2 production) leading to a reduction in PaCO2. The physiology of patients with chronic hyperventilation is poorly understood, and there is no typical clinical presentation. Symptoms can include dyspnea, paresthesias, tetany, headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, and atypical chest pain. Because symptoms can be so diverse, patients with chronic hyperventilation present to a variety of health care providers, including internists, neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and pulmonologists. 
It is helpful to think of hyperventilation as having initiating and 
sustaining factors. Some investigators believe that an initial event leads to increased alveolar ventilation and a drop in PaCO2 to  ∼ 20 mmHg. The ensuing onset of chest pain, breathlessness, paresthesia, or altered consciousness can be alarming. The resultant increase in minute volume to relieve these acute symptoms only serves to exacerbate symptoms that are often misattributed by the patient and health care workers to cardiopulmonary disorders. An unrevealing evaluation for causes of these symptoms often results in patients being anxious and fearful of additional attacks. It is important to note that  anxiety disorders and panic attacks are not synonymous with hyperventilation . Anxiety disorders can be both an initiating and sustaining factor in the pathogenesis of chronic hyperventilation, but these are not necessary for the development of chronic hypocapnia. 
■  DIAGNOSIS Respiratory symptoms associated with acute hyperventilation can be the initial manifestation of systemic illnesses such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Causes of acute hyperventilation need to be excluded before a diagnosis of chronic hyperventilation is considered. Arterial blood gas sampling that demonstrates a compensated respiratory alkalosis with a near normal pH, low PaCO2, and low calculated bicarbonate is necessary to confirm chronic hyperventilation. Other causes of respiratory alkalosis, such as mild asthma, need to be 
diagnosed and treated before chronic hyperventilation can be considered. A high index of suspicion is required as increased minute ventilation can be difficult to detect on physical examination. Once chronic hyperventilation is established, a sustained 10% increase in alveolar ventilation is enough to perpetuate hypocapnia. This increase can be accomplished with subtle changes in the respiratory pattern, such as occasional sigh breaths or yawning 2–3 times per min. 
TREATMENT 
There are few well-controlled treatment studies of chronic hyperventilation owing to its diverse features and the lack of a universally accepted diagnostic process. Clinicians often spend considerable time identifying initiating factors, excluding alternative diagnoses, and discussing the patient’s concerns and fears. In some patients, reassurance and frank discussion about hyperventilation can be liberating. Identifying and eliminating habits that perpetuate hypocapnia, such as frequent yawning or sigh breathing, can be helpful. Some evidence suggests that breathing exercises and diaphragmatic retraining may be beneficial for some patients. The evidence for using medications to treat hyperventilation is scant. Beta blockers may be helpful in patients with sympathetically mediated symptoms such as palpitations and tremors.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA) are both classified as sleep-related breathing disorders. OSA and CSA share some risk factors and physiologic bases but also have unique features. Each disorder is associated with impaired ventilation during sleep and disruption of sleep, and each diagnosis requires careful elicitation of the patient’s history, physical examination, and physiologic testing. OSA, the more common disorder, causes daytime sleepiness and impaired daily function. It is a cause of hypertension and is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease in adults and behavioral problems in children. CSA is less common and may occur alone or in combination with OSA. It can occur as a primary condition, as a response to high altitude, or secondary to a medical condition (such as heart failure) or medication (such as opioids). Patients with CSA often report frequent awakenings and daytime fatigue and are at increased risk for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. 
■  OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/HYPOPNEA SYNDROME Definition  OSA is defined on the basis of nocturnal and daytime symptoms as well as sleep study findings. Diagnosis requires the patient to have (1) either symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances (snoring, snorting, gasping, or breathing pauses during sleep) or daytime sleepiness or fatigue that occurs despite sufficient opportunity to sleep and is unexplained by other medical problems; and (2) five or more episodes of obstructive apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep (the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], calculated as the number of episodes divided by the number of hours of sleep) documented during a sleep study. OSA also may be diagnosed in the absence of symptoms if the AHI is ≥15 episodes/h. Each episode of apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing for at least 10 s and commonly results in a ≥3% drop in oxygen saturation or a 
brain cortical arousal. OSA severity can be characterized by the frequency of breathing disturbances (AHI), the amount of oxyhemoglobin desaturation with respiratory events, the duration of apneas and hypopneas, the degree of sleep fragmentation, and the level of reported daytime sleepiness or functional impairment. 
Pathophysiology  During inspiration, intraluminal pharyngeal pressure becomes increasingly negative, creating a “suctioning” force. Because the pharyngeal airway has no fixed bone or cartilage, airway patency is dependent on the stabilizing influence of the pharyngeal dilator muscles. Although these muscles are continuously activated during wakefulness, neuromuscular output declines with sleep onset. In patients with a collapsible airway, the reduction in neuromuscular output results in transient episodes of pharyngeal collapse (manifesting as an “apnea”) or near collapse (manifesting as a “hypopnea”). The episodes of collapse are typically terminated when ventilatory reflexes are activated and cause arousal, thus stimulating an increase in neuromuscular activity and opening of the airway. The airway may collapse at different sites, such as the soft palate (most common), tongue base, lateral pharyngeal walls, and/or epiglottis  ( Fig. 297-1 ) . OSA may be most severe during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when neuromuscular output to the skeletal muscles is particularly low, and in the supine position due to gravitational forces. 
apnea  include the palate, the tongue, and/or the epiglottis. In addition, collapse can also occur due to the lateral pharyngeal walls. 
levels of neuromuscular activation to maintain patency during wakefulness and thus are predisposed to airway collapse following the normal sleep-related reduction in pharyngeal muscle activity during sleep. The airway lumen may be narrowed by enlargement of soft tissue structures (tongue, palate, and uvula) due to fat deposition, increased lymphoid tissue, or genetic variation. Craniofacial factors such as mandibular retroposition or micrognathia, reflecting genetic variation or developmental influences, also can reduce lumen dimensions. In addition, lung volumes influence the caudal traction on the pharynx and consequently the stiffness of the pharyngeal wall. Accordingly, low 
lung volume in the recumbent position, which is particularly pronounced in the obese, contributes to collapse (less caudal traction). A high degree of nasal resistance (e.g., due to nasal septal deviation or polyps) can contribute to airway collapse by reducing intraluminal pressure downstream in the pharynx. High-level nasal resistance also may trigger mouth opening during sleep, which breaks the seal between the tongue and the palate and allows the tongue to fall posteriorly and occlude the airway. 
Pharyngeal muscle activation is integrally linked to ventilatory 
drive. Thus, factors related to ventilatory control, particularly ventilatory sensitivity, arousal threshold, and neuromuscular responses to carbon dioxide (CO2), contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA. A buildup in CO2 during sleep activates both the diaphragm and the pharyngeal muscles. Pharyngeal activation stiffens the upper airway and can counteract inspiratory suction pressure and maintain airway patency to an extent that depends on the anatomic predisposition to collapse. However, pharyngeal collapse can occur when the ventilatory control system is overly sensitive to CO2, with resultant wide fluctuations in ventilation, ventilatory drive, and upper airway stiffness. Moreover, increasing levels of CO2 during sleep result in central nervous system arousal, causing the individual to move from a deeper to a lighter level of sleep or to awaken. A low arousal threshold (i.e., awakening to a low level of CO2 or ventilatory drive) can preempt the CO2-mediated process of pharyngeal muscle compensation and prevent airway stabilization. A high arousal threshold, conversely, may prevent appropriate termination of apneas, prolonging apnea duration and exacerbating oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Finally, any impairment in the ability of the muscles to compensate during sleep can contribute to collapse of the pharynx. The relative contributions of risk factors vary among individuals. Approaches to the measurement of these factors in clinical settings, with consequent enhancement of “personalized” therapeutic interventions, are being actively investigated. 
Risk Factors and Prevalence  The major risk factors for OSA are obesity, male sex, and older age. Additional risk factors include 
mandibular retrognathia and micrognathia, a positive family history of OSA, sedentary lifestyle, genetic syndromes that reduce upper airway patency (e.g., Down syndrome, Treacher-Collins syndrome), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (especially in children), menopause (in women), and various endocrine syndromes (e.g., acromegaly, hypothyroidism). 
Approximately 40–60% of cases of OSA are attributable to 
excess weight. Obesity predisposes to OSA through the narrowing effects of upper airway fat on the pharyngeal lumen. Obesity also reduces chest wall compliance and decreases lung volumes, resulting in a loss of caudal traction on upper airway structures. Obese individuals are at a fourfold or greater risk for OSA than their normal-weight counterparts. A 10% weight gain is associated with a >30% increase in AHI. Even modest weight loss or weight gain can influence the risk and severity of OSA. However, the absence of obesity does not exclude this diagnosis. 
The prevalence of OSA is twofold higher among men than among 
women. Factors that predispose men to OSA include android pattern of obesity (resulting in upper-airway and abdominal fat deposition) and relatively greater pharyngeal length, which increases collapsibility. Premenopausal women are relatively protected from OSA by the influence of sex hormones on ventilatory drive. The decline in sex difference in older age reflects an increased OSA prevalence in women after menopause. The pathogenesis and presentation of OSA also differ in men and women: compared to men, women have a lower arousal threshold and less neuromuscular collapsibility. Women tend to have shorter duration of apneas and apneas that occur predominantly in REM sleep. Failure to recognize these differences can contribute to underrecognition of OSA in women. 
Variations in craniofacial morphology that reduce the size of the 
posterior airway space increase OSA risk. The contribution of skeletal structural features to OSA is most evident in nonobese patients. Identification of features such as retrognathia can influence therapeutic decision-making. 
OSA has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by its significant 
familial aggregation and heritability. For a first-degree relative of a 
patient with OSA, the odds of having OSA is approximately twofold higher than that of someone without an affected relative. Several genetic variants have been associated with prevalence of OSA or with related traits, such as the frequency of apneas and hypopneas, the duration of respiratory events, and degree of overnight levels of hypoxemia. 
OSA prevalence varies with age, from 5 to 15% among middle- 
aged adults to >20% among elderly individuals, although in a majority of affected adults, the disorder is undiagnosed. There is a peak due to lymphoid hypertrophy among children between the ages of 3 and 8 years; with airway growth and lymphoid tissue regression during later childhood, prevalence declines. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in adolescence and adulthood, OSA prevalence again increases. 
The prevalence of OSA is especially high among patients with 
certain medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Individuals of East Asian ancestry appear to be at increased risk of OSA at relatively low levels of body mass index, reflecting the greater influence of craniofacial risk factors. In the United States, African Americans, especially children and young adults, are at higher risk for OSA than their white counterparts. 
Course of the Disorder  The precise onset of OSA is usually hard to identify. A person may snore for many years, often beginning in childhood, before OSA is identified. Weight gain may precipitate an increase in symptoms, which in turn may lead the patient to pursue an evaluation. OSA may become less severe with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In adults, there is a gradual increase in AHI with age, although marked increases and decreases in the AHI are uncommon unless accompanied by weight change. 
APPROACH TO THE PATIENT 
An evaluation for OSA should be considered in patients with symptoms of OSA and one or more risk factors. Screening also 
should be considered in patients who report symptoms consistent with OSA and who are at high risk for OSA-related morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. 
from a bed partner or household member. Snoring is the most common complaint; however, its absence does not exclude the diagnosis, as pharyngeal collapse may occur without tissue vibration. Gasping or snorting during sleep may also be reported, reflecting termination of individual apneas with abrupt airway opening. Dyspnea is unusual, and its absence generally distinguishes OSA from paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nocturnal asthma, and acid reflux with laryngospasm. Patients also may describe frequent awakening or sleep disruption, which is more common among women and older adults. The most common daytime symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, identified by a history of difficulty maintaining alertness or involuntary periods of dozing. However, many women preferentially report fatigue rather than sleepiness. Other symptoms include a dry mouth, nocturnal heartburn, diaphoresis of the chest and neck, nocturia, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, and mood disturbances. Insomnia, which is common in the general population, may coexist with OSA. Although difficulty falling sleep is rarely caused by OSA, awakening at apnea termination may cause difficulty maintaining sleep, a symptom more likely to be reported by women than by men, and often responds to treatment of OSA. Several questionnaires that evaluate snoring frequency, self-reported apneas, and daytime sleepiness can facilitate OSA screening. The predictive ability of a questionnaire can be enhanced by a consideration of whether the patient is male or has risk factors such as obesity or hypertension. 
as well as comorbid conditions, particularly vascular disease. On examination, patients may exhibit hypertension and regional 
(central) obesity, as indicated by a large waist and neck circumference. The oropharynx may reveal a small orifice with crowding due to an enlarged tongue, a low-lying soft palate with a bulky uvula, large tonsils, a high-arched palate, or micro-/retrognathia. Since nasal resistance can increase the propensity to pharyngeal collapse, the nasal cavity should be inspected for polyps, septal deviation, allergic rhinitis, and other signs of obstruction. Because patients with heart failure are at increased risk for both OSA and CSA, a careful cardiac examination should be conducted to detect possible left- or right- sided cardiac dysfunction. Evidence of cor pulmonale suggests a comorbid cardiopulmonary condition; OSA alone is not thought to cause right-heart failure. A neurologic evaluation is needed to evaluate for conditions such as neuromuscular and cerebrovascular diseases, which increase OSA risk. 
  Since symptoms and signs do not accurately predict the severity of sleep-related breathing disturbances, specific diagnosis and categorization of OSA severity requires objective measurement of breathing during sleep. The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA is an overnight polysomnogram (PSG). A negative in-laboratory PSG usually rules out OSA. However, false-negative studies can result from night-to- night variation in OSA severity, particularly if there was insufficient REM sleep or less supine sleep during testing than is typical for the patient. Home sleep tests that record only respiratory and cardiac channels are commonly used as a cost-effective means for diagnosing OSA. However, a home study may yield a false- negative result if sleep time is not accurately estimated or in individuals experiencing hypopneas with arousals rather than oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Therefore, if there is a high prior probability of OSA, a negative home study should be followed by PSG. 
The key physiologic information collected during a sleep study 
for OSA assessment includes measurement of breathing (changes in airflow, respiratory excursion), oxygenation (hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation), body position, and cardiac rhythm. In addition, PSGs and some home sleep studies measure sleep continuity and sleep stages (by electroencephalography, chin electromyography, electro-oculography, and actigraphy), leg movements, and snoring intensity. This information is used to quantify the frequency and subtypes of abnormal respiratory events during sleep as well as associated changes in oxygen hemoglobin saturation, arousals, and sleep stage distributions.  Tables 297-1  and  297-2  define the respiratory events scored and the severity guidelines employed during a sleep study.  Fig. 297-2  shows examples of sleep-related respiratory events. A typical sleep study report provides quantitative data such as the AHI (number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep) and the profile of oxygen saturation over the night (mean, nadir, time at low levels). Reports may also include the respiratory disturbance index, which includes the number of respiratory effort–related arousals in addition to the AHI. In-laboratory PSG also quantifies sleep latency (time from “lights off” to first sleep onset), the frequency of periodic limb movements during sleep, sleep efficiency (percentage of time asleep relative to time in bed), arousal index (number of cortical arousals per hour of sleep), and time in each sleep stage. These metrics can further characterize the severity of OSA, which is associated with an increased arousal index, low sleep efficiency, and a reduction of time in deep (stage N3) and REM sleep and increase in light (stage N1) sleep. The detection of autonomic responses to apneas and hypopneas, such as surges in blood pressure, changes in heart rate, and abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, also provides relevant information on OSA severity.

  Various imaging studies, including cephalometric radiography, upper airway MRI and CT, and fiberoptic endoscopy, can be used to identify anatomic risk factors for OSA. While these may be useful for planning surgical interventions, they are not indicated in the routine evaluation of OSA. Cardiac testing may yield evidence of impaired systolic or diastolic ventricular function or abnormal cardiac structure. Overnight blood pressure monitoring often displays a “nondipping” pattern (absence of the typical 10% fall of blood pressure during sleep compared to wakefulness). Arterial blood gas measurements made during wakefulness are usually normal. Waking hypoxemia or hypercarbia suggests coexisting cardiopulmonary disease or hypoventilation syndromes. Patients with severe nocturnal hypoxemia may have elevated hemoglobin values. A multiple sleep latency test or a maintenance of wakefulness test can be useful in quantifying sleepiness and helping to distinguish OSA from narcolepsy. 
Health Consequences and Comorbidities  OSA is the most common medical cause of daytime sleepiness and negatively influences quality of life. It is also strongly associated with cardiac, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disorders and with premature death. This broad range of health effects is attributable to the impact of sleep fragmentation, cortical arousal, and intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia on vascular, cardiac, metabolic, and neurologic functions. OSA-related respiratory events stimulate sympathetic overactivity, leading to acute blood pressure surges during sleep and nocturnal as well as daytime hypertension. OSA-related hypoxemia also stimulates release of acute-phase proteins and reactive oxygen species that exacerbate insulin resistance and lipolysis and cause an augmented prothrombotic and proinflammatory state. Inspiratory effort against an occluded airway causes large intrathoracic negative 
pressure swings, altering cardiac preload and afterload and resulting in cardiac remodeling and reduced cardiac function. Hypoxemia and sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance also may cause electrical remodeling of the heart and myocyte injury. 
and hypertensive ranges, increase the prevalence of a nondipping overnight blood pressure pattern, and increase the risk of uncontrolled and resistant hypertension. Elevations in blood pressure are due to augmented sympathetic nervous system activation as well as alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and fluid balance. Treatment of OSA with nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to reduce 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Although the overall impact of CPAP on blood pressure levels is relatively modest (averaging 2– 4 mmHg), larger improvements are observed among patients who have a high AHI, report daytime sleepiness, or have resistant hypertension. 
impact on cardiac and metabolic functions. Strong epidemiologic evidence indicates that OSA significantly increases the risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure with and without reduced ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, stroke, and diabetes. Treatment of OSA has been shown to reduce several markers of cardiovascular risk and improve insulin resistance and, in uncontrolled studies, is associated with a decreased recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation. Recent randomized clinical trials, however, have failed to demonstrate that OSA treatment with CPAP reduces cardiac event rates or prolongs survival. These outcomes may reflect exclusion from these trials of patients with excessive sleepiness, as there is evidence that sleepy patients may have the greatest OSA-related cardiovascular risk. Limited adherence to treatment among trial participants or the widespread use of other effective secondary prevention measures, such as beta blockade, antiplatelet agents, 
and lipid-lowering therapy, may also limit the impact of CPAP on cardiovascular risk. 
report daytime sleepiness. Patients with OSA symptoms have a twofold increased risk of occupational accidents. Individuals with elevated AHIs are involved in motor vehicle crashes approximately two to three times as often as persons with normal AHIs. Randomized controlled trials have shown that treatment of OSA with CPAP alleviates sleepiness as measured by either questionnaire or objective testing in patients with both mild and more severe disease. However, the degree of improvement varies widely. Residual sleepiness may be due to several factors, including suboptimal treatment adherence, insufficient sleep time, other sleep disorders, or prior hypoxic-mediated damage in brain areas involved in alertness. Moreover, visceral adipose tissue, which is present in higher amounts in patients with OSA, releases somnogenic cytokines that may contribute to sleepiness. Thus, even after treatment, it is important to assess and monitor patients for residual sleepiness and to optimize treatment adherence, improve sleep patterns, and identify other disorders that may contribute to sleepiness. Careful and supervised use of alerting agents may be appropriate as adjunctive treatment in patients in whom sleepiness does not respond to CPAP alone. 
are common in patients with OSA, with the largest decrements observed in scales that measure physical functioning and energy levels. Work-related productivity also has been shown to improve in patients with moderate to severe OSA treated with CPAP. Numerous studies, including a large-scale trial of minimally symptomatic patients, have shown that treatment with CPAP can improve these patient-reported outcomes. Depressive symptoms, in particular somatic symptoms (irritability, fatigue, lack of energy), are commonly reported in OSA and improve with CPAP. 
TREATMENT 
A comprehensive approach to the management of OSA is needed to reduce risk factors and comorbidities. The clinician should seek to identify and address lifestyle and behavioral factors as well as comorbidities that may be exacerbating OSA. As appropriate, treatment should aim to reduce weight; optimize sleep duration (7–9 h); regulate sleep schedules (with similar bedtimes and wake times across the week); encourage the patient to avoid sleeping in the supine position; treat nasal allergies; increase physical activity; eliminate alcohol ingestion (which impairs pharyngeal muscle activity) within 3 h of bedtime; and minimize use of opiate medications. Sedative hypnotic medications have inconsistent effects on OSA but should be avoided in most patients with moderate to severe OSA. Patients should be counseled to avoid drowsy driving. 
CPAP is the standard medical therapy with the highest level of 
evidence for efficacy. Delivered through a nasal or nasal-oral mask, CPAP works as a mechanical splint to hold the airway open, thus maintaining airway patency during sleep. An overnight CPAP titration study can determine the optimal pressure setting that reduces the number of apneas/hypopneas during sleep, improves gas exchange, and reduces arousals; however, the use of “auto- titrating” CPAP devices used in home settings has eliminated the need for titration sleep studies in many patients. Rates of adherence to CPAP treatment are highly variable (average, 50– 80%) and may be improved with support by a skilled health care team who can address side effects, help the patient “problem solve,” and provide motivational education  ( Table 297-3 ) . Despite the limitations of CPAP, controlled studies have demonstrated its beneficial effect on alertness, mood, quality of life, work-related productivity, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity. Uncontrolled studies also indicate a favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes, cardiac ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation recurrence, and mortality risk. 
TABLE 297-3 Side Effects of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Their Treatments 
Oral appliances for OSA work by advancing the mandible, thus 
opening the airway by repositioning the lower jaw and pulling the tongue forward. These devices generally work better when customized for patient use; maximal adaptation can take several weeks. Efficacy studies show that these devices can reduce the AHI by ≥50% in two-thirds of individuals, although these data are based largely on patients with mild OSA. Some patients with moderate or severe OSA respond to oral appliances as well, although no consistent predictors of success have been identified in these groups, and thus, follow-up sleep testing is recommended. Side effects of oral appliances include temporomandibular joint pain and tooth movement; thus, they require that the patient have adequate dental and periodontal structures. Oral appliances are most often used for treating patients with mild/moderate OSA or patients who do not tolerate CPAP. However, as some patients are more adherent to oral appliances than to CPAP, these devices are under investigation for treatment of more severe disease. 
Upper airway surgery for OSA is less efficacious than CPAP and 
is mostly reserved for the treatment of patients who snore, have mild OSA, or cannot tolerate CPAP. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (removal of the uvula and the margin of the soft palate) is the most commonly performed surgery for OSA and, although results vary greatly, is generally less successful than treatment with oral 
appliances. Upper airway surgery is less effective in severe OSA and in obese patients. Success rates may be higher for multilevel surgery (involving more than one site/structure) performed by an experienced surgeon, but the selection of patients is an important factor and relies on careful targeting of culprit areas for surgical resection. Bariatric surgery is an option for obese patients with OSA and can improve not only OSA but also other obesity-associated health conditions. Other procedures that can decrease snoring but have minimal effects on OSA include injection of a hardening agent to the soft palate (resulting in stiffening), radiofrequency ablation, laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, and palatal implants. 
Upper airway neurostimulation is a recently tested alternative 
treatment for OSA. Unilateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve through a surgically implanted device was shown to significantly decrease the AHI and improve a number of patient-reported outcomes, such as sleepiness and quality of life, for a duration of at least 5 years after treatment in carefully selected patients. This therapy is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or fail CPAP therapy. Current inclusion criteria are moderate to severe OSA (AHI 15–65), BMI <32 kg/m2, and absence of complete concentric collapse at the level of the velum documented by awake and drug- induced endoscopy (a predictor of response to surgery). Additional research is underway to further evaluate longer-term effectiveness and potential utility of this treatment in other patient groups. 
Supplemental oxygen can improve oxygen saturation, but there 
is little evidence that it improves OSA symptoms or the AHI in unselected patients. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of supplemental oxygen on blood pressure in patients with OSA. 
CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA CSA, which is less common than OSA, may occur in isolation or, more often, in combination with obstructive events in the form of “mixed” apneas. CSA is often caused by an increased sensitivity to PCO2, which leads to an unstable breathing pattern that manifests as hyperventilation alternating with apnea. A prolonged circulation delay between the pulmonary capillaries and carotid 
chemoreceptors is also a contributing cause; thus, individuals with congestive heart failure are at risk for CSA. With prolonged circulation delay, there is a crescendo-decrescendo breathing pattern known as  Cheyne-Stokes breathing  ( Fig. 297–2 B ). Other risk factors for CSA include opioid medications (which appear to have a dose-dependent effect on CSA) and hypoxia (e.g., breathing at high altitude). In some individuals, CPAP—particularly at high pressures—seems to induce central apnea; this condition is referred to as  complex sleep apnea  or  treatment-emergent central sleep apnea . Rarely, CSA may be caused by blunted chemosensitivity due to congenital disorders (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome) or acquired factors. CSA is an independent risk factor for the development of both heart failure and atrial fibrillation, possibly related to elevations in sympathetic nervous system activity that accompany this disorder; alternatively, CSA may be an early marker of subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Patients with CSA may report symptoms of frequent awakenings as well as daytime fatigue. Treatment of CSA is difficult and depends on the underlying cause. Limited data suggest that supplemental oxygen can reduce the frequency of central apneas, particularly in patients with hypoxemia, and ongoing clinical trials are further evaluating supplemental oxygen for use in patients with heart failure and CSA. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is treated by optimizing therapy for heart failure. At this time, there is no good evidence that CPAP, including  adaptive servoventilation  (a form of ventilatory support that attempts to regularize the breathing pattern), improves health outcomes in patients with Cheyne-Stokes breathing without OSA, and in fact, it may be detrimental in those with heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction.

■  END-STAGE LUNG DISEASE AND INDICATIONS FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTATION For the purpose of lung allocation score (LAS) prioritization for organ allocation, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) divides advanced lung disease diagnoses into four categories: (A) obstructive lung disease (including non-cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis and obliterative bronchiolitis), (B) pulmonary vascular disease, (C) cystic fibrosis, and (D) restrictive lung disease. Historically, obstructive lung disease was the most common indication for transplantation, but since the implementation of the LAS system, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common restrictive lung disease, has become an increasingly frequent indication for transplantation. Prior to the era of antifibrotic therapy, the average life expectancy from the time of diagnosis of IPF was 3– 5 years, making patients with this disease the cohort to experience most clearly a survival benefit from lung transplantation. As a result, the LAS system prioritizes patients with IPF. Similarly, patients who experience secondary effects of their lung disease, including pulmonary hypertension, right heart dysfunction, and hypercarbia, are prioritized for allocation and should be considered for referral for transplant evaluation irrespective of other markers of disease severity. 
Generally, the trajectory of decline and evolution of disease are 
key indicators of the appropriate timing for referral and listing for lung transplantation, rather than absolute thresholds of disease severity. However, suggested guidelines for referral have been elucidated for specific disease states. For example, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the most common obstructive lung disease for which transplantation is considered, the Body-Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise Capacity (BODE) Index is often used as a marker of disease severity, with an index of 5 an 
appropriate indication for referral for evaluation, and 7 for listing for transplantation. Other suggested markers for transplant consideration in obstructive lung disease include pulmonary function test (PFT) data, such as a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of <25% predicted. The frequency and severity of exacerbations of disease should also be considered in determining the appropriate timing of referral. 
With the marked advances in medical therapy for pulmonary 
vascular disease over the past decade, transplantation for pulmonary vascular disease has become less frequent but is still an important consideration for patients who progress despite, or are refractory to, treatment. Functional assessments such as New York Heart Association class III or IV limitations and hemodynamic measurements such as cardiac index <2 L/min per m2 would suggest consideration for evaluation and listing. Patients with diagnoses generally poorly responsive to therapy such as pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be referred early for evaluation. 
Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have historically been 
considered for evaluation when the FEV1 reaches approximately 30% predicted. However, with the exciting development of therapies targeting the CF transmembrane receptor, providers should keep in mind the potential for improvement in pulmonary function after treatment initiation. Despite this potential for pharmacotherapeutic response, referral and completion of testing should be considered so that patients are prepared for listing should they fail to see improvement or experience worsening of disease on therapy. Moreover, patients who experience acceleration of acute exacerbation rate, recurrent hemoptysis, worsening functional and/or nutritional status, or colonization with resistant bacteria should also be assessed for transplantation irrespective of pulmonary function results. 
Despite treatment progress with the development of antifibrotic 
therapy for IPF and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases, these therapies do not reverse the disease but only slow the rate of lung function decline. Therefore, transplant referral for patients with IPF and other fibrosing lung diseases should still be considered at the time of diagnosis. Forced vital capacity <80% 
predicted or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide <40% predicted, failure to respond to medical therapy, decline in pulmonary function tests on therapy, and functional decline are additional indications for transplant consideration in patients with other restrictive lung diseases. 
■  CONTRAINDICATIONS TO LUNG TRANSPLANTATION Absolute Contraindications  As experience with lung transplantation increases, and as lung allocation policy prioritizes patients with higher acuity of disease and with diseases affecting older age groups, recipient selection criteria have become more liberal compared to prior eras. While published guidelines suggest absolute and relative contraindications to transplantation, these criteria are in constant evolution, and each program ultimately establishes its own selection algorithms based upon clinical expertise, experience, program size and resources, and referral patterns. 
Examples of absolute contraindications to lung transplantation 
( Table 298-1 )  include anatomic and technical considerations that would affect the ability to complete the transplant procedure, such as chest wall or spinal deformities or malacia of the large airways. Surgical input is critical in making such determinations. In addition, untreatable and/or irreversible organ dysfunction may preclude isolated lung transplantation. Cirrhosis of the liver, uncorrectable disease of the coronary arteries not amenable to combined surgical intervention during the transplant procedure, or other forms of uncorrectable atherosclerotic or vascular disease may make transplantation too high risk for consideration. Renal dysfunction is of particular concern given the known nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors, which are the mainstay of posttransplant immune suppression. 
TABLE 298-1 Contraindications to Lung Transplantation 
Relative Contraindications  Age in and of itself is typically not a contraindication to transplantation at most centers. However, older patients with significant medical comorbidities may be at prohibitive risk for transplantation, and functional status and frailty may worsen in this setting. Published analyses of the Scientific Registry of 
Transplant Recipients, a comprehensive database of transplant outcomes, have consistently shown that functional capacity, as assessed by 6-minute walk distance, is inversely correlated with both wait list and posttransplant mortality. As a result, most programs utilize some assessment of functional status as a criterion for transplant candidacy. 
Frailty, independent of walk distance, has also been recognized 
increasingly as a marker of poor outcome after lung transplantation, and can be assessed using a number of instruments, including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), and others. Most studies utilizing these instruments have been conducted at single centers. While both SPPB and FFP have been shown to correlate with the LAS, FFP has a stronger correlation, and SPPB and FFP may not correlate with each other. Further study is needed to determine prospectively the relationship between these measures assessed in the pretransplant setting and posttransplant outcomes. 
Patients with a history of malignancy are generally required to 
have experienced a period of remission prior to consideration for transplantation. The necessary length of disease-free survival should be determined in the context of the type of malignancy, stage at diagnosis, and likelihood of recurrence, and often varies by program. 
A history of respiratory infection and colonization with resistant 
organisms is of particular concern in the CF and bronchiectasis populations, although it could affect patients with any advanced lung disease and a history of respiratory infection. Data on outcomes in the presence of resistant  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection are conflicting, but in general, patients who have demonstrated a response to an antimicrobial regimen, even if colonized with resistant organisms, can be considered for transplantation.  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, another group of gram-negative organisms that can infect patients with CF, also presents a unique concern for transplantation. Data show that  B. cenocepacia  (formerly known as Genomovar III) portends the highest risk posttransplant, often leading to bacteremia, abscess formation, and early mortality.  B. dolosa  and  gladioli  may cause similar posttransplant complications. Patients colonized with other  Burkholderia  species appear to have 
posttransplant outcomes comparable with the noncolonized population, and, therefore, can be considered for transplantation. Published guidelines suggest that those programs offering transplantation to patients colonized with  B. cenocepacia  do so under a research structure and after a specific discussion of the risks of transplantation in this setting with the patients. Other infectious considerations in lung transplant candidates include mycobacterial infections, particularly with rapidly growing organisms such as  M. abscessus , which can lead to chronic, refractory infections and infections of the chest wall. In the case of fungal infection, assessment of the pathogenicity of the organism, resistance patterns, and, in some cases, responsiveness to pretransplant treatment, is beneficial in determining the safety of transplantation. 
A history of viral infections such as hepatitis and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is generally not considered a contraindication to transplantation. Demonstration of adequate control of infection and responsiveness to therapy are important in preparation for transplantation, and development of a treatment plan that minimizes toxicity and drug interactions, in consultation with transplant pharmacy, should be completed prior to placement on the wait list. Collaborative assessment with transplant infectious disease experts is beneficial whenever the infectious history is a concern for transplant safety. 
Nutritional status is another important element to assess in 
determining candidacy for lung transplantation. Nutritional status has been shown to have a U-shaped relationship with transplant outcomes, with increased mortality risk associated with both underweight (BMI <18) and obesity (specifically BMI >35). Consultation with nutritional experts may allow for modification of this risk prior to transplant. In some underweight patients, placement of an enteral feeding tube and initiation of enteral feedings may be considered. 
Psychosocial assessment is also a key component of the 
evaluation of patients under consideration for lung transplantation, and a multidisciplinary approach with transplant social work, psychiatry, and financial care coordination is often helpful. Assessment for and optimization of psychiatric disorders such as 
anxiety and depression, which can be exacerbated in the setting of transplantation, substance abuse disorders, and compliance with medical therapy recommendations are all important parts of the pretransplant evaluation. Perioperative pain management planning in the setting of medical therapy for opioid use disorder may require additional multidisciplinary input, but the need for this management plan alone should not preclude transplantation. Transplant candidates require a strong support system given their potential posttransplant care needs. Additionally, confirmation of insurance coverage for all phases of transplant care, expected medication copayments, and financial resources to support other expenses in the setting of transplantation should be completed during the transplant evaluation. Fundraising opportunities and subsidies for medications may need to be pursued in order to proceed safely with listing. 
■  LUNG TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT Lung transplant candidates need meticulous and exquisite medical care to ensure that they are in excellent condition at the time of transplant. Oxygen is prescribed to maintain adequate systemic oxygenation to allow for moderate physical activity and exertion. Patients should be enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programs, if available, and should continue to participate in daily physical exercises. Fluid management is important to consider and restriction of free water and salt intake is recommended. 
Patients with pulmonary vascular disease and severe pulmonary 
hypertension awaiting lung transplantation need special attention to maintain adequate right ventricular function. The use of pulmonary vasodilator therapy is recommended and should not be stopped prior to transplant. Patients who develop secondary pulmonary hypertension should also be assessed for the utility of direct pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Periodic assessment of right ventricular function with echocardiography is recommended, and in patients with clearly worsening ventricular function, right heart catheterization and assessment for responsiveness to short-acting vasodilator therapy should be considered. 
In restrictive lung disease patients awaiting transplant, 
consideration should be given to continuation of immune modulators and/or antifibrotic therapy. Studies are ongoing to determine the impact of antifibrotic therapy on posttransplant wound healing. Additionally, increased pulmonary vascular resistance can occur in these patients as the disease progresses, and acute exacerbations have been shown to be associated with severe acute decrease in right ventricular function. Steroids have been utilized in the management of acute exacerbations; however, the negative sequelae of chronic steroid use on wound healing is well established. Therefore, steroid use should be limited as much as possible, and if unavoidable, should be tapered rapidly. 
Patients with CF can have pancreatic dysfunction leading to 
difficulty in maintaining normal blood glucose levels; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can make the management of posttransplant blood glucose very challenging. Therefore, optimization of diabetes management should be pursued prior to transplantation. 
Despite optimal medical therapy, the underlying disease in wait- 
listed patients will almost always continue to worsen. Prioritization of patients awaiting lung transplant is determined by the LAS. The score is generated by giving weight to risk factors associated with predicted mortality while on the wait list while also accounting for the expected posttransplant survival of the patient. This composite score is then normalized to generate a score between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the more prioritized the patient, and the higher the probability of a suitable donor match for the recipient. The main factors that influence the LAS are the underlying diagnosis of the patient (such as restrictive lung disease, as mentioned above), the demographics of the patient (gender and age), and the patient’s current clinical status. The more acutely ill the patient (the patient’s oxygen requirements, pulmonary hypertension, use of invasive support systems such as mechanical circulatory support or ventilatory support, limited mobility, lack of independence with activities of daily living), the higher the score. This results in a system of organ allocation that is most efficient at ensuring that the sickest patients receive the organs available. However, despite this prioritization strategy, patients continue to expire at a rate of 10–12 
patient deaths per 100 patient-years on the wait list. It is critical for the best outcomes in these patients that ongoing clinical assessment and frequent updates of the LAS are routine aspects of their management. 
A major consequence of improved efficiency in matching the 
sickest patients to the available pool of donors has been an increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices to bridge the most critically ill patients to transplant. Mechanical circulatory support with ECMO allows for patients to be potentially weaned from the ventilator, to maintain physical activity and ambulation, and to be in a state of greater robustness as they await transplant. The posttransplant survival rate of patients bridged to transplant with ECMO is lower than patients transplanted without the need for ECMO but better than patients who had previously been transplanted directly from mechanical ventilatory support. Furthermore, with improvements in membrane oxygenator technology, platform miniaturization, and improvements in cannula design, outcomes continue to improve. 
■  DONOR CONSIDERATIONS The ideal lung donor has remained constant since the inception of lung transplantation in the 1980s  ( Table 298-2 ) . A donor between 25–40 years of age, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio >350, no smoking history, a clear chest x-ray, clean bronchoscopy, and minimal ischemic time is considered the ideal donor; however, it is quite rare that a donor meets all of these criteria for transplantation. In fact, the vast majority of donor lungs used for transplant fall outside these ideal lung donor criteria as established more than three decades ago. Donors must have irreversible brain injury, and the majority of donors are brain dead. Only 20% of all donors with brain death are suitable lung donors due to the development of severe neurogenic pulmonary edema and increased susceptibility of potential lung allografts to infection and injury. 
TABLE 298-2 Characteristics of the Ideal Lung Donor 
Absolute contraindications to lung donation include radiographic 
evidence of chronic lung disease such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Other absolute contraindications include active malignancy, a donor history of severe asthma requiring multiple hospitalizations, and positive HIV status. Relative contraindications include older donor age, severe thoracic trauma with extensive pulmonary contusions, the presence of pulmonary hypertension, and prolonged donor hypotension or acute hypoxemia. 
The standard lung donor evaluation includes a donor medical and 
social history, physical examination, and laboratory examination. Chest imaging is mandatory, as are arterial blood gases, bronchoscopy, and serological tests for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C, HIV, toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin, and herpes simplex virus. The presence of consolidation and atelectasis, while not absolute contraindications to transplant, are often difficult to assess with noncontrast radiographic imaging alone. Ventilation parameters must be evaluated to ensure adequate compliance of the donor lungs, with peak airway pressures <30 cmH2O being ideal. Direct on-site inspection of the lungs and assessment for nodules, compliance, and full expansion are the final necessary steps before acceptance of donor lungs for transplant. 
More recently, there has been an expanded use of allografts from 
donors after cardiac death (DCD) due to the ability to rehabilitate donor lungs using ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). DCD donors are 
patients who present with irreversible brain injury but without overt brain death. The potential donor allografts are often exposed to a period of prolonged warm ischemia during the donation process; there has been a concern about early graft dysfunction after DCD donation. Steen and colleagues in Lund demonstrated that EVLP could be used to assess these marginal donors prior to transplant. The landmark publication of the Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion in Clinical Lung Transplantation trial in 2011 generated renewed interest in DCD lung donors. The group from the University of Toronto was also able to demonstrate that brain-dead donors with unacceptable donor lung parameters could be rehabilitated with the use of EVLP. They were able to salvage up to 50% of selected unsuitable donor lung allografts with the use of acellular normothermic hyperosmotic perfusion with excellent short-term outcomes. 
Donor Management  Brain death causes severe perturbations in the potential donor lung allograft function. The development of severe pulmonary edema often accompanies brain death. The hemodynamic instability and neurogenic shock that can accompany brain death are also major stressors on the preservation of donor allograft function. The primary goal of donor management is, therefore, the maintenance of hemodynamic stability and preservation of donor lung function. Judicious fluid resuscitation and avoidance of excessive resuscitation should be employed. Volume replenishment should be limited to maintain the central venous pressure between 5 and 8 mmHg. In general, crystalloid fluid boluses are to be avoided. Diabetes insipidus is common in donors and requires the use of intravenous vasopressin to prevent excessive urine loss. In general, blood transfusions should be avoided; however, if necessary, CMV-negative and leukocyte-filtered blood should be used whenever possible. Hypothermia should be avoided as it predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and metabolic acidosis. 
Excessive oxygen delivery should be minimized to prevent free- 
radical injury to the potential lung allograft. Positive end-expiratory pressures on the ventilator should be maintained to avoid the 
development of atelectasis. More recently, airway pressure release ventilation modes of ventilation have been utilized to preserve lung function and minimize barotrauma from prolonged ventilation. 
■  PROCUREMENT OPERATION Prior to incision, a thorough bronchoscopic evaluation is completed. The anatomy of the donor airways is defined. Any secretions that may be present are evacuated and the airways are examined to rule out the presence of any lesions or masses. The epithelial lining is inspected for evidence of excessive friability and hemorrhage, which may indicate significant infection. A median sternotomy incision is employed to access the chest for lung procurement. The pleural spaces are opened and both lungs are inspected, palpated, and gently recruited to evaluate for suspicious nodules, consolidation, and/or pulmonary infarction. 
The donor is systemically heparinized, and the main pulmonary 
artery is cannulated. Fifteen minutes prior to initiation of the explant, prostacyclin is introduced into the main pulmonary artery and allowed to circulate through the lungs. This vasoreactive prostanoid helps to ensure adequate pulmonary flush by dilating the pulmonary vasculature. The heart is arrested first, then the pulmonoplegia solution is instilled into the lungs at a low controlled pressure. Topical iced-saline solution is instilled into both pleural spaces. After the heart has been explanted, the individual pulmonic veins are flushed retrogradely. The lungs are then re-expanded, the trachea is clamped, and the explanted allograft is stored in ice-cold saline solution for transport. If the right and left lungs are being procured for different recipients, the posterior left atrium, the main pulmonary artery, and the left main-stem bronchus are divided to separate the right and left lungs, and the organs are stored and shipped separately. 
■  RECIPIENT OPERATION AND EARLY POSTTRANSPLANT CONSIDERATIONS Recipient Operation  The recipient operation can be divided into two parts. The first part involves the explant of the native lung and the 
second part involves the implant of the new lung. There are generally three main surgical approaches to the completion of the operation: a right or left thoracotomy, a transverse thoracosternotomy (clamshell), or median sternotomy. These approaches are all favored by various centers for different benefits. The thoracotomy approach allows for explant and implant of donor lungs without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and is often the preferred approach for single-lung transplant. The clamshell incision offers the advantages of increased exposure compared to either thoracotomy or median sternotomy but comes at the cost of greater morbidity and postoperative wound complications. This incision can be used to perform bilateral lung transplants and allows for the possibility of avoiding CPB. A median sternotomy approach can be used to perform bilateral lung transplant. This approach offers the advantage of fewer wound complications, less postoperative pain, and flexibility with more complex or concomitant cardiac procedures at the time of lung transplant. This approach mandates the use of CPB. The routine use of CPB allows for early pneumonectomies without hemodynamic compromise and can significantly reduce the ischemic time to the second allograft. Additionally, overcirculation to the first allograft can be minimized with the routine use of CPB. Others prefer to avoid CPB as avoidance may be associated with decreased need for blood product administration and lower incidence of primary graft dysfunction. 
Anesthetic monitoring for lung transplant should include arterial 
pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, temperature monitoring, and urine output monitoring. Large-bore IV access and central venous access are vital to manage the patient safely. On a selective basis, pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring may be useful. For patients without the planned use of CPB, double- lumen endotracheal tubes are mandatory, whereas they can be avoided for patients transplanted on CPB. 
Once access to the thorax has been completed, the hilar 
structures are isolated and divided. The bronchial anastomosis is completed first, and the anastomosis is checked to ensure that it is secure by insufflating the lung gently while keeping the anastomosis 
under saline solution to observe for bubbles. The donor left atrial cuff incorporating the pulmonary vein is connected to the native left atrium and the donor right or left pulmonary artery is connected to the native pulmonary artery. After completion of the vascular anastomoses, the lungs are gently reperfused. During this early reperfusion period, lung-protective ventilation strategies are employed and oxygen tension is reduced. The patient is transitioned to normal ventilation, drains are placed in the thoracic cavity, and the wounds are closed. 
Induction of Immunosuppression  Initiation of immunosuppression starts with induction of the patient under general anesthesia. Many programs utilize an induction agent (most commonly an IL-2 receptor/CD25 antagonist, but antithymocyte globulin, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, or other induction agents may also be used), and systemic corticosteroids and purine modulators are administered after induction is complete. If an IL2 receptor antagonist is utilized for induction, a second dose is administered 4 days after the original dose. An additional dose of methylprednisolone is administered after allograft reperfusion in the operating room. Three-drug immune suppression is initiated with a calcineurin inhibitor, purine modulator, and continued systemic corticosteroids. In patients with severe acute renal dysfunction, calcineurin inhibitor initiation may be delayed. 
Perioperative Considerations and Complications  Early morbidity and mortality after lung transplant most commonly are sequelae of primary graft dysfunction or infection. Very rarely, hyperacute rejection has been observed; however, with the implementation of robust systems to ensure ABO and HLA compatibility at the time of transplant, the occurrence of hyperacute rejection is extremely uncommon. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) encompasses a constellation of findings that result in poor early graft function after transplant. This phenomenon is often the consequence of ischemia- reperfusion injury in the allograft and is not related to infection or rejection. It is characterized by a diffuse pattern of infiltrates on the chest x-ray and poor pulmonary gas exchange with PaO2:FiO2 ratios <300, with severe PGD characterized by diffuse severe infiltrates 
and a P:F ratio of <100 at 72 h posttransplant. Most cases of PGD are mild and self-limiting, resolving with supportive care. However, if the PGD is severe and worsening despite maximal medical therapy, diuresis, inotropic therapy, maximal ventilation support, and paralysis of the patient, mechanical circulatory support with ECMO can become necessary. The incidence of severe PGD has been steady over the past two decades at approximately 10–15% in most programs. 
Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are leading causes of 
morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. The lung is one of the few solid organs that is in continuous contact with the environment. Each breath has the potential to introduce new organisms, and the reduced lymphatic function and mucociliary clearance in the transplanted lung increase the risk of serious infection. The highest incidence of infection is early after lung transplant and coincides with the intensity of immune suppression. Early infections, occurring within the first month after transplantation, are commonly bacterial (especially gram-negative bacilli) and manifest as pneumonia, mediastinitis, urinary tract infections, catheter sepsis, and skin infections. Patients can develop pathogenic infections with organisms associated with pretransplant colonization, and perioperative antibiotic regimens are often deployed to address this. Viral infections, and CMV infections, in particular, can lead to severe recipient disease and early loss of graft and life. The majority of transplant programs employ antiviral prophylaxis in the early transplant period to avoid such complications. Invasive fungal infections peak in frequency between 10 days and 2 months after transplantation. Fungal prophylaxis regimens in the early posttransplant period vary widely. Treatment consists of inhaled amphotericin B in the setting of airway infection and/or azole therapy with more advanced or invasive disease. The institution of prophylaxis with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (or inhalational pentamidine for sulfa-allergic patients) has effectively prevented Pneumocystis  pneumonia. The risk of  Pneumocystis  infection is highest during the first year after transplant. However, as infections can also occur late after transplant, most centers recommend prophylactic therapy be continued for life. 
■  LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF LUNG TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS While survival after lung transplantation continues to improve by era, the survival rates in this group are lower than in other solid-organ cohorts. Approximately 50% of lung transplant recipients will experience at least one episode of acute rejection in the first posttransplant year, and by 5 years posttransplant, approximately half will have developed chronic rejection. As a result, posttransplant immune suppression regimens may be more aggressive than in other solid-organ recipients, as described above. The immunosuppressive regimen must be balanced against the potential toxicities that accrue with these medications over time. 
Acute cellular rejection in lung transplant recipients is most 
common in the first posttransplant year, with a decreased but not absent frequency thereafter. Infections can stimulate cellular rejection, most clearly demonstrated in the setting of CMV infection, but also noted after other infections. Most programs incorporate a schedule of routine surveillance bronchoscopy to assess for acute cellular rejection posttransplant. Acute cellular rejection manifests as a lymphocytic infiltrate involving the distal small vessels and capillaries and/or a lymphocytic bronchiolitis involving the distal airways of the lung. Acute cellular rejection, a risk factor for the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), is treated with augmented immune suppression. Antibody-mediated rejection in its classic form is a neutrophilic vasculitis associated with the small vessels and capillaries of the lung, with associated deposition of by-products of the complement cascade, in the setting of allograft dysfunction and circulating donor-specific HLA antibodies in the blood. The manifestations of antibody-mediated rejection in the lung allograft are less specific than in other organs. Further research is ongoing into the diagnostic and treatment considerations of this entity in lung transplantation. 
CLAD is an overarching description of the syndrome of long-term 
allograft rejection. The classic manifestation of CLAD is obliterative bronchiolitis, the development of fibrinous material within the distal airways that leads to small-airways obstruction. As transbronchial biopsies are insensitive for diagnosing obliterative bronchiolitis, a 
clinical diagnostic designation of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome can be made when specific PFT criteria are met and other causes of PFT decline are excluded. CLAD can also present as a restrictive phenotype, with imaging demonstrating upper lobe–predominant pleural thickening, small lung volumes, and interstitial changes on high-resolution CT. Numerous therapies for CLAD have been utilized, including azithromycin, montelukast, extracorporeal photopheresis, alemtuzumab, and others, with varying degrees of success. 
Infection is a significant complication of lung transplantation, with 
persistent risk over the lifetime of the transplant recipient. As time progresses, the chance of opportunistic infection increases. The risk of bacterial infection and fungal infection remains, and can affect the lung parenchyma, airways and anastomotic sites, and other organs. Viral infections such as CMV reactivation and infection, EBV- associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, and other rarer infections can also develop in the later posttransplant setting as well. 
Numerous longer-term medical complications can be seen in lung 
transplant recipients. Essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and bone loss are some examples of chronic medical conditions observed following transplantation. A multidisciplinary approach to care that involves the patient’s primary care physician, local pulmonologist, and appropriate subspecialists, along with transplant pharmacy, as well as social work and care coordination, is beneficial in addressing the complex needs of lung transplant recipients over time. Predictors of short- and long-term outcomes after lung transplantation are outlined in  Table 298-3 .

Interventional pulmonary medicine is a subspecialty of pulmonary and critical care medicine focusing on the evaluation and management of patients with thoracic malignancy, central airway obstruction, pleural disease, and advanced obstructive lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema and asthma. Novel minimally invasive interventions have drastically changed the way we care for patients. In this chapter, we will summarize recent developments and evolving technologies in interventional pulmonology (IP). 
With the introduction of the rigid bronchoscope by Gustav Killian in 1897, the mortality associated with foreign-body aspiration dropped from over 90% to less than 5%, as patients no longer had to suffer from airway obstruction and postobstructive pneumonia. Shigeto Ikeda developed the flexible bronchoscope in 1967, allowing access to the peripheral airways and lung parenchyma. Bronchoscopy has remained an important diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, and recent technology has significantly increased its utility. 
■  Endobronchial Ultrasound The diagnosis and staging of lung cancer remains one of the most important roles of advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy and IP. Convex endobronchial ultrasound (cEBUS) is a flexible bronchoscope combined with ultrasound technology that allows for real-time visualization during transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and masses adjacent to the airways  ( Fig. 299-1 ) .

become the gold standard for lung cancer staging and can provide sufficient tissue to perform molecular profiling to guide targeted therapies in lung cancer with adequacy rates for testing that exceed 95%. cEBUS is also extremely helpful in diagnosing mediastinal and hilar adenopathy due to sarcoidosis and lymphoma. 
■  Peripheral Bronchoscopy Evaluations of pulmonary nodules and lung masses are frequent indications for bronchoscopy as a way to achieve a minimally invasive diagnosis. Historically, the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy 
to target peripheral pulmonary lesions was approximately <60%. To improve on targeting success, multiple guidance platforms allow for more distal improved access in the periphery of the lung. 
Smaller bronchoscopes that are <4 mm in diameter can be 
combined with available imaging tools to improve target localization. Radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound utilizes a radial scanning ultrasound probe that is inserted through the bronchoscope and into the lung, producing a real-time image of the target lesion. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) involves image- guidance systems that manipulate thin-slice CT images to create virtual airway reconstructions used as guided maps during bronchoscopy. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopic platforms offer the enhanced articulation and stability of a robotic arm replacing the traditional flexible bronchoscope. Additional studies are currently underway to explore further the utility of these systems for peripheral lesion biopsy. 
Therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated for the relief of malignant and nonmalignant central airway obstruction, asthma, and emphysema. Active research is also focusing on the utility of bronchoscopy for the ablation of early-stage lung cancer, as well as the treatment of chronic bronchitis. 
■  Central Airway Obstruction Central airway obstruction (CAO) describes obstruction of the trachea, main stem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, and/or lobar bronchi, and can present as intrinsic (endoluminal), extrinsic (extraluminal), or mixed (extraluminal tumor resulting in mass effect and endoluminal involvement)  ( Fig. 299-2 ) . The differential diagnosis of CAO is shown in  Table 299-1 . 
TABLE 299-1 Differential Diagnosis of Central Airway Obstruction 
but then progress with increasing severity of obstruction to dyspnea at rest, stridor, and respiratory failure. Patients may also have wheezing, hemoptysis, or symptoms of postobstructive infection. Rigid bronchoscopy is the preferred tool to manage CAO in conjunction with ablative therapies, balloon bronchoplasty, and airway stenting to offer rapid symptomatic relief with immediate reductions in the level of required care. Therapeutic bronchoscopy for CAO has been shown to improve significantly both quality of life and survival. 
■  Ablative Therapies for CAO Ablative therapy in the airway consists of both heat (laser, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation) and cold (cryotherapy) modalities. These techniques are most commonly used to destroy tumor and provide hemostasis. The cryoprobe can also be used for foreign-body removal. Other modalities, such as brachytherapy (BRT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), have a delayed therapeutic effect and are often not suitable for situations where immediate relief of airway obstruction is desired. 
■  Bronchoplasty 
Bronchoplasty (or bronchial dilation) can be achieved with the barrel of the rigid bronchoscope or with balloons that can be passed via the rigid or flexible bronchoscope. Bronchoplasty is most commonly used for dilation of stenotic airways or disruption of webs related to nonmalignant causes of airway diseases. Although dilation generally leads to immediate relief of the stenosis, results can be short-lived and, hence, this technique is often combined with airway stenting. Complications are rare but can include airway tears if proper techniques are not followed. 
■  Airway Stenting After airway patency is achieved, airway stents can be utilized to prevent recurrence of CAO. Reports of endoscopically implantable stents for the airways date back to 1914. Airway stents are commonly used to treat patients with CAO due to extrinsic compression from a variety of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Stents are effective and lead to symptomatic relief in >90% of patients. A variety of airway stents are available, each with its own benefits and detriments; it is important to choose the right stent for the specific indication. Stent complications are not uncommon and include mucostasis, infection, and the development of granulation tissue. First-generation biodegradable stents, custom 3-dimensional-printed stents, and drug-coated stents are currently being evaluated, working toward a personalized medicine approach wherein stents are tailored to an individual’s airway anatomy and underlying disease. 
■  Endobronchial Intratumoral Chemotherapy Endobronchial intratumoral chemotherapy (EITC) is an intervention aimed at improving and/or maintaining airway patency in patients with malignant CAO, with the potential to eliminate the need for airway stenting and its associated complications. Under bronchoscopic guidance, high-dose therapeutics can be injected directly into tumor to enhance response and limit systemic side effects. Most recently, a novel microneedle injection catheter has been used to optimize drug delivery of paclitaxel, and was shown to 
be both feasible and safe with no restenosis. Additional studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of EITC. 
■  Ablative Therapies for Early-Stage Lung Cancer Bronchoscopic ablation of early-stage lung cancer has long been described as the “holy grail” of bronchoscopy due to the appeal of staging, diagnosing, and treating biopsy-proven early-stage lung cancer in one procedural setting. There is limited experience with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation (B-RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) as a potential means to treat early-stage lung cancer. Ultimately, the efficacy of bronchoscopic ablation of early- stage nonoperable lung cancer must be proven in longitudinal studies demonstrating noninferiority in survival as compared to the current gold standard of stereotactic body radiation (SBRT). 
■  Bronchoscopic Therapies for Asthma Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a treatment for patients with severe persistent asthma who remain symptomatic despite maximal medical treatment that delivers radiofrequency energy to the airways to reduce their smooth muscle mass. A pivotal randomized clinical trial did not show a change in FEV1 or airway hyperresponsiveness, but was able to demonstrate an improvement in quality of life and reduction in exacerbation rates, visits to the emergency department, and days lost from school or work. At this time, the ideal asthma phenotypes and ideal candidates for this treatment modality remain to be determined. 
■  Bronchoscopic Therapies for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), published in 2003, demonstrated that lung volume reduction (LVR) surgery for severe emphysema confers improved survival and exercise capacity in patients with upper lobe–predominant disease and poor exercise capacity. At the same time, it showed high perioperative morbidity and mortality. During the last decade, several bronchoscopic therapeutic modalities have been tested, including valves, coils, 
steam, stents, and foam, in patients with severe emphysema to mimic the physiologic effects of surgical lung volume reduction (SLVR) in a less invasive fashion. 
■  Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) via valve placement involves placement of one-way valves in airways leading to areas of the lung with significant emphysema, allowing air and mucus to exit but blocking air entry to achieve lobar collapse. Several clinical trials on BLVR with valves have demonstrated improvements in lung function and overall improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance. The overall safety profile of these valve systems compares favorably with surgical LVR with a much lower rate of perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
■  Targeted Lung Denervation Targeted lung denervation is a novel therapy that involves bronchoscopic ablation of peribronchial parasympathetic nerves in order to achieve permanent bronchodilation. Unlike bronchoscopic LVR, which focuses exclusively on patients with emphysema, targeted lung denervation is potentially applicable more broadly to all COPD patients, with studies showing a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when compared with a sham denervated group. 
■  Pleural Interventions Thoracic ultrasound has become invaluable in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Medical thoracoscopy (also called  pleuroscopy ) is a minimally invasive technique most commonly used to evaluate recurrent exudative pleural effusions, and is associated with a diagnostic yield of >95%. 
Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have gained tremendous 
popularity and have been declared by evidence-based guidelines to be as acceptable as chemical pleurodesis for the management of symptomatic malignant pleural effusions. When comparing IPC and pleurodesis via talc slurry, two multicentered, open-label, randomized controlled trials demonstrated IPC effectively relieved 
dyspnea, decreased the duration of hospital stay, and lessened the need for future procedures. 
Pleural infection (empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion) 
is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The mainstay of therapy typically consisted of antibiotics, drainage of the infected pleural space with tube thoracostomy, and possible need for surgical decortication. The landmark Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST2) demonstrated that intrapleural sequential administration of rTPA and DNase resulted in significant radiographic and clinical improvements and allowed >90% of patients to avoid surgery. 
■  Pneumothorax and Persistent Air Leak Persistent air leak is defined as a nonresolving pneumothorax with an air leak lasting more than 5–7 days. For over a decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has maintained a humanitarian device exemption for compassionate use of the Spiration Valve System for management of persistent air leak following lobectomy, segmentectomy, or LVR surgery, although the device has also been used “off label” for the treatment of persistent air leak due to primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces. 
IP provides diagnostic and therapeutic options that span the spectrum of benign and malignant airway and pleural disorders. The constant innovations in diagnostic and treatment modalities have continued to help push the boundaries of pulmonary medicine.
