(Chap. 305) The obstructive lung diseases are characterized by a reduction in\nthe forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, typically\nbelow 0.70. The typical lung diseases that manifest with airways obstruction include chronic\nobstructive lung disease (which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis), asthma,\nbronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Asbestosis (Chap. 311) is a lung disease caused by the\ninhalation of asbestos fibers. It is a fibrotic lung disease and typically manifests with a restrictive\nventilator defect and gas transfer defect (reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide\n[DLCO]) on pulmonary function testing.\nVI-2.   The answer is B. (Chap. 305) The alveolar-arterial oxygen (A-a O2) difference can be helpful in\ndistinguishing hypoventilation (elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO2]) as a cause of\nhypoxemia. The A-a O2 difference on room air should be less than 15 mmHg in a young adult\nand typically increases slightly with age. The A-a O2 difference cannot easily be interpreted\nwhen the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is greater than 0.21. The A-a O2 difference on room\nair is elevated in situations of hypoxemia due to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, shunt, or\ndiffusion defect. It will be normal when the hypoxemia is solely due to hypoventilation. In this\ncase, the gradient is 7.5 mmHg, consistent with hypoventilation secondary to a presumed\nnarcotic overdose. Asthma and pulmonary embolism typically cause hypoxemia due to V/Q\nmismatch. Pneumococcal and pneumocystis pneumonias cause hypoxemia for multifactorial\nreasons, including shunt.\nVI-3.   The answer is B. (Chap. 306e) The functional residual capacity of the lung refers to the volume\nof air that remains in the lung following a normal tidal respiration. This volume of air represents\nthe point at which the outward recoil of the chest wall is in equilibrium with the inward elastic\nrecoil of the lungs. The lungs would remain at this volume if not for the actions of the\nrespiratory muscles. The functional residual capacity is comprised of two lung volumes: the\nexpiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. The expiratory reserve volume represents\nthe additional volume of air that can be exhaled from the lungs when acted upon by the\nrespiratory muscles of exhalation. The residual volume is the volume of air that remains in the\nlung following a complete exhalation and is determined by the closing pressure of the small\nairways.\nVI-4.   The answer is D. (Chap. 306e) This patient is presenting with subacute dyspnea, stridor, and\nairflow obstruction, which are consistent with a diagnosis of subglottic stenosis related to his\nprior prolonged mechanical ventilation. This is confirmed by the finding of fixed airflow\nobstruction on the flow-volume loop. Flow-volume loops are derived from spirometry. Following\na maximum inspiratory effort from residual volume, an individual forces the maximum volume\nof air from their lungs, and the resultant flows are plotted against the volume. By convention,\ninspiration is shown on the lower portion of the curve and expiration is on the top. There are\ncharacteristic patterns of airflow obstruction that can be evaluated by examining this curve. A\nfixed central airflow obstruction results in flattening of the flow-volume loop in both inspiration\nand expiration, yielding the characteristic box-like effect, as shown in Figure VI-4B. Examples of\nfixed airflow obstruction include tracheal stenosis and an obstructing central airway tumor.\nOther patterns of large airway obstruction are a variable intrathoracic obstruction and variable\nextrathoracic obstruction. In these situations, flattening of the flow-volume curve occurs on only\none limb of the flow-volume loop, and the pattern of flattening can be explained by the dynamic\nchanges in pressure that affect the trachea. A variable intrathoracic obstruction causes flattening\nof the flow-volume curve only on expiration. During inspiration, the pleural pressure is more\nnegative than the tracheal pressure, and the trachea remains unimpeded to flow. However, when\npleural pressure rises on expiration relative to tracheal pressure, there is collapse of the trachea\nand flattening of flow-volume curve. An example of a variable intrathoracic obstruction is\ntracheomalacia. In contrast, the variable extrathoracic defect leads to flattening of the flow-\nvolume loop on inspiration but not expiration. The relevant pressure acting on airflow in the\ntrachea in an extrathoracic obstruction is atmospheric pressure. During inspiration, the tracheal\npressure drops below atmospheric pressure, leading to compromised airflow and the\ncharacteristic flattening of the flow-volume loop. However, tracheal pressure rises above\natmospheric pressure during expiration, leading to a normal expiratory curve.\nFIGURE VI-4B Flow-volume loops. A. Normal. B. Airflow obstruction. C. Fixed central airway\nobstruction. RV, residual volume; TLC, total lung capacity.\nVI-5.   The answer is B. (Chap. 306e) Pregnancy is a known risk factor for the development of venous\nthromboembolic disease and should be suspected in any pregnant patient presenting with acute\ndyspnea. Determining the need for further testing in a pregnant patient should take into account\nthe potential risks of radiation exposure on the fetus. Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of\npulmonary embolism are often nonspecific. Most chest x-rays are normal, and sinus tachycardia\nmay be the only finding on electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition, in the pregnant patient,\ndyspnea is common due to a variety of factors including the effects of progesterone as a central\nrespiratory stimulant and increased size of the uterus later in pregnancy. The normal arterial\nblood gas in pregnancy shows a chronic respiratory alkalosis with a pH ranging as high as 7.47\nand partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) between 30 and 32 mmHg. Calculation of\nthe alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) can be helpful in this situation. It is easy to be fooled\nby the presence of a normal oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen on arterial blood\ngas, but the A-a gradient may still be elevated in the presence of respiratory alkalosis. In this\ncase, the A-a gradient is elevated at 32 mmHg (should be <15 in a young adult in second\ntrimester of pregnancy) and should prompt the physician to perform further workup for\npulmonary embolism. The choice of test for diagnosis pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients\nis most commonly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, although ventilation-\nperfusion scanning may also be used.\nVI-6. VI-7, VI-8, and VI-9. The answers are C, B, D, and A, respectively. (Chap. 306e) Ventilatory\nfunction can be easily measured with lung volume measurement and the FEV1/FVC ratio. A\ndecreased FEV1/FVC ratio is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases. Alternatively, low lung\nvolumes, specifically decreased total lung capacity (TLC), and occasionally decreased residual\nvolume (RV) are characteristic of restrictive lung diseases. With extensive air trapping in\nobstructive lung disease, TLC is often increased, and RV may also be increased. Vital capacity\n(VC) is proportionally decreased. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measures respiratory\nmuscle strength and is decreased in patients with neuromuscular disease. Thus, myasthenia\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio. The hallmark of obstructive\nlung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a decreased FEV1/FVC\nratio.\nVI-10.   The answer is C. (Chap. 306e) In this patient presenting with multilobar pneumonia,\nhypoxemia is present that does not correct with increasing the concentration of inspired oxygen.\nThe inability to overcome hypoxemia or the lack of a notable increase in partial pressure of\narterial oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen saturation (SaO2) with increasing fraction of inspired oxygen\nphysiologically defines a shunt. A shunt occurs when deoxygenated blood is transported to the\nleft heart and systemic circulation without having the capability of becoming oxygenated. Causes\nof shunt include alveolar collapse (atelectasis), intra-alveolar filling processes, intrapulmonary\nvascular malformations, or structural cardiac disease leading to right-to-left shunt. In this case,\nthe patient has multilobar pneumonia leading to alveoli that are being perfused but unable to\nparticipate in gas exchange because they are filled with pus and inflammatory exudates. Acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome is another common cause of shunt physiology. V/Q mismatch is\nthe most common cause of hypoxemia and results when there are some alveolar units with low\nratios (low ventilation to perfusion) that fail to fully oxygenate perfused blood. When blood is\nreturned to the left heart, the poorly oxygenated blood admixes with blood from normal alveolar\nunits. The resultant hypoxemia is less severe than with shunt and can be corrected with\nincreasing the inspired oxygen concentration. Hypoventilation with or without other causes of\nhypoxemia is not present in this case, as the PCO2 <40 mmHg indicates hyperventilation. The\nacidosis present in this case is of a metabolic rather than a pulmonary source. Because the\npatient is paralyzed, she is unable to increase her respiratory rate above the set rate to\ncompensate for the metabolic acidosis.\nVI-11.   The answer is A. (Chap. 307) This patient is at risk of infection and malignancy. The findings\non positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are consistent with either diagnosis. Her risk of\ninfection, particularly aspiration pneumonia, is related to her scleroderma-induced esophageal\ndysfunction, history of low-grade fever, and location. Most aspiration pneumonias involve the\nright lower lobe, particularly the superior segment. They may appear as consolidation or nodular\ninfiltrates. Given her history of smoking, she is also at risk of primary lung malignancies.\nFluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET can often differentiate benign from malignant lesions as small as\n1 cm. However, false-positive results are seen in inflammatory conditions, such as pneumonia or\ngranulomatous diseases. False-negative findings can occur in lesions with low metabolic activity\nsuch as carcinoid tumors and bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas.\nVI-12.   The answer is D. (Chap. 307) This patient presents with a slowly progressive illness manifested\nby dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, clubbing, and the presence of crackles on examination. In\naddition, the pulmonary function tests demonstrate restrictive lung disease. This scenario is\ncharacteristic of an individual with interstitial lung disease, most commonly idiopathic\npulmonary fibrosis in individuals at this age. A more thorough history should be obtained to\ndetermine if there are any other exposures or symptoms that could identify other causes of\ninterstitial lung disease. The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a high-\nresolution CT scan (HRCT) of the chest. HRCT employs thinner cross-sectional images at\napproximately 1–2 mm rather than the usual 7–10 mm. This creates more visible details and is\nparticularly useful for recognizing subtle changes of the interstitium and small airways including\ninterstitial lung disease, bronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial\nbiopsy typically does not provide the detail required to adequately diagnose interstitial lung\ndisease. It may be considered if there are specific features on HRCT that would suggest an\nalternative diagnosis. However, in most instances, the pathologic diagnosis of interstitial lung\ndisease requires a surgical lung biopsy to provide definitive diagnosis. This patient’s symptoms\ndo not suggest coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. Thus, echocardiography and\nnuclear stress testing are not indicated. CT scanning has evolved over the years to offer several\ndifferent techniques that are useful in a variety of circumstances. Standard CT imaging is most\nuseful for the evaluation and staging of lung masses. Helical CT scanning requires only a single\nbreath hold and provides continuous collection of data with improved contrast enhancement and\nthinner collimation. Once the data are obtained, the images can be reconstructed into other\nviews including sagittal and coronal planes as well as three-dimensional volumetric\nrepresentations. A recent use of this technology is employed in the setting of virtual\nbronchoscopy to aid in the planning and performance of bronchoscopy. Multidectector CT scans\ncan obtain multiple slices in a single rotation that are thinner than the usual cuts. Multidetector\nCT scanners are used in the performance of the CT pulmonary angiogram.\nVI-13.   The answer is B. (Chap. 309) Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with interplay between genetic\nand environmental factors (Table VI-13). Several risk factors that predispose to asthma have\nbeen identified. These should be distinguished from triggers, which are environmental factors\nthat worsen asthma in a patient with established disease. Atopy is the major risk factor for\nasthma, and nonatopic individuals have a very low risk of developing asthma. Patients with\nasthma commonly suffer from other atopic diseases, particularly allergic rhinitis, which may be\nfound in over 80% of asthmatic patients, and atopic dermatitis (eczema). The familial association\nof asthma and a high degree of concordance for asthma in identical twins indicate a genetic\npredisposition to the disease; however, whether or not the genes predisposing to asthma are\nsimilar or in addition to those predisposing to atopy is not yet clear. It now seems likely that\ndifferent genes may also contribute to asthma specifically, and there is increasing evidence that\nthe severity of asthma is also genetically determined. Although viral infections (especially\nrhinovirus) are common triggers of asthma exacerbations, it is uncertain whether they play a\nrole in etiology. There is some association between respiratory syncytial virus infection in\ninfancy and the development of asthma, but the specific pathogenesis is difficult to elucidate\nbecause this infection is very common in children. The role of dietary factors is controversial.\nObservational studies have shown that diets low in antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin\nA, magnesium, selenium, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (fish oil) or high in sodium and\nomega-6 polyunsaturated fats are associated with an increased risk of asthma. Vitamin D\ndeficiency may also predispose to the development of asthma. However, interventional studies\nwith supplementary diets have not supported an important role for these dietary factors. Obesity\nis also an independent risk factor for asthma, particularly in women, but the mechanisms are\nthus far unknown. Air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, and diesel particulates, may\ntrigger asthma symptoms, but the role of different air pollutants in the etiology of the disease is\nmuch less certain. Most evidence argues against an important role for air pollution because\nasthma is no more prevalent in cities with a high ambient level of traffic pollution than in rural\nareas with low levels of pollution. There is some evidence that maternal smoking is a risk factor\nfor asthma, but it is difficult to dissociate this association from an increased risk of respiratory\ninfections.\nTALBLE VI-13   Risk Factors and Triggers Involved in Asthma\nVI-14.   The answer is E. (Chap. 309) The patient in this clinical scenario presents with symptoms\ntypical of asthma, including shortness of breath and wheezing. She also manifests evidence of\natopy, the most common risk factor for developing asthma, with sensitivity to outdoor allergens\nand cats. In addition, the patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and eczema, both of which are\ncommonly seen in individuals with asthma. Indeed, over 80% of asthma patients have a\nconcomitant diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Atopy is present in 40%–50% of the population of\naffluent countries, but only a small proportion of these individuals develop asthma. Many studies\nhave shown a genetic predisposition via family history and recent genome-wide screens, but no\nsingle genetic profile has shown high positive predictive value. Overall, the prevalence of asthma\nin developed countries has increased over the past 30 years, but recently has leveled off, with a\nprevalence of about 15% in children and 10%–12% in adults. Asthma deaths remain rare and\nhave decreased in recent decades. In the 1960s, asthma deaths did increase with an overuse of\nshort-acting β-agonist medications. However, since the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids as\nmaintenance therapy, deaths have declined. Risk factors for fatal asthma include frequent use of\nrescue inhalers, lack of therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, and prior hospitalizations for\nasthma. Interestingly, the overall disease severity does not vary significantly within a given\npatient over the course of the disease. Individuals who have mild asthma typically continue to\nhave mild asthma, whereas those with severe disease present with severe disease. Diagnosis of\nasthma can be made by demonstrating airflow obstruction with significant reversibility on\nbronchodilator administration. In this case, the FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased to 70%, which is\nlow. In addition, the FEV1 increases by 12.4% and 230 mL. This meets the criteria for\nbronchodilator reversibility of increases of at least 200 mL and 12%. Bronchoprovocation testing\nwith methacholine can be considered in individuals who have suspected asthma but have normal\npulmonary function tests.\nVI-15.   The answer is B. (Chap. 309) The pathology of asthma has largely been determined by\nexamining bronchial biopsies of patients with asthma as well as the lungs of individuals who die\nfrom asthma. These pathologic changes are centered around the airways with sparing of the\nalveolar spaces. The airways are infiltrated by eosinophils, activated T lymphocytes, and\nactivated mucosal mast cells. However, the degree of inflammation does not correlate with the\nseverity of asthma. Another common finding in all asthmatics and individuals with eosinophilic\nbronchitis is thickening of the basement membrane due to collagen deposition in the\nsubepithelium. The airway smooth muscle is hypertrophied as well. Overall, this leads to\nthickening of the airway wall, which may also exhibit edematous fluid, particularly in those with\nfatal asthma. In cases of fatal asthma, it is also common to find multiple airways that are\noccluded by mucus plugs. However, the disease is limited to the airways, and infiltration of the\nalveolar spaces by inflammatory cells is not seen.\nVI-16.   The answer is C. (Chap. 309) The preferred method for diagnosing asthma is demonstration of\nairflow obstruction on spirometry that is at least partially reversible. This is demonstrated in\noption C, with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, decreased FEV1, and a significant increase in FEV1\nfollowing administration of albuterol. For an individual to be considered responsive to a\nbronchodilator, the individual should experience an increase in either FEV1 or FVC of at least\n200 mL and 12%. Option A describes someone with postviral cough syndrome, which can persist\nfor several weeks following a viral upper respiratory infection. Option B describes someone with\nexercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which, in absence of other symptoms to suggest\nasthma, should not be diagnosed as asthma. Isolated EIB lacks the characteristic airway\ninflammation of asthma and does not progress to asthma. Although it is estimated that 80%–90%\nof individuals with asthma experience EIB, many individuals who have EIB do not also have\nasthma. EIB is caused by hyperventilation with inhalation of cool dry air that leads to\nbronchospasm. Option D describes someone with occupational asthma that has occurred after\nworking with animals in the medical laboratory for many years. Symptoms that are\ncharacteristic of occupational asthma are symptoms only while at work that improve on the\nweekends and during holidays. Option D describes someone with COPD. In COPD, 25%–48% of\nindividuals can demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsive in response to methacholine.\nVI-17.   The answer is A. (Chap. 309) The main drugs for asthma can be divided into bronchodilators,\nwhich give rapid relief of symptoms mainly through relaxation of airway smooth muscle, and\ncontrollers, which inhibit the underlying inflammatory process (Figure VI-17). For patients with\nmild, intermittent asthma, a short-acting β2-agonist is all that is required. However, use of a\nreliever medication more than twice a week indicates the need for regular controller therapy.\nThis patient is using her reliever medication frequently; therefore, a controller should be added\nto her regimen. The treatment of choice for all patients is an inhaled corticosteroid given twice\ndaily. It is usual to start with an intermediate dose (e.g., 200 μg twice a day of beclomethasone\ndipropionate or equivalent) and to decrease the dose if symptoms are controlled after 3 months.\nIf symptoms are not controlled, a long-acting β-agonist (LABA) should be added, which is most\nconveniently given by switching to a combination inhaler. The dose of controller should be\nadjusted accordingly, as judged by the need for a rescue inhaler. Muscarinic receptor antagonists\nsuch as ipratropium bromide prevent cholinergic nerve-induced bronchoconstriction and mucus\nsecretion. They are less effective than β2-agonists in asthma therapy because they inhibit only\nthe cholinergic reflex component of bronchoconstriction, whereas β2-agonists prevent all\nbronchoconstrictor mechanisms. Anticholinergics, including tiotropium, may be used as\nadditional bronchodilators in patients with asthma that is not controlled by inhaled\ncorticosteroid and LABA combinations. Low doses of theophylline or an antileukotriene may also\nbe considered as an add-on therapy, but these are less effective than LABA. If asthma is not\ncontrolled despite the maximal recommended dose of inhaled therapy, it is important to check\ncompliance and inhaler technique. In these patients, maintenance treatment with an oral\ncorticosteroid may be needed, and the lowest dose that maintains control should be used.\nFIGURE VI-17 Stepwise approach to asthma therapy according to the severity of asthma and ability to\ncontrol symptoms. ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; LABA, long-acting β2-agonist; OCS, oral corticosteroid.\nVI-18.   The answer is A. (Chap. 309) Approximately one-third of asthmatic patients who are pregnant\nimprove during the course of a pregnancy, one-third deteriorate, and one-third are unchanged. It\nis important to maintain good control of asthma because poor control may have adverse effects\non fetal development. Compliance may be a problem because there is often concern about the\neffects of antiasthma medications on fetal development. The drugs that have been used for many\nyears in asthma therapy have now been shown to be safe and without teratogenic potential.\nThese drugs include short-acting β-agonists (e.g., albuterol), inhaled corticosteroids (e.g.,\nbeclomethasone), and theophylline; there is less safety information about newer classes of drugs\nsuch as LABAs (e.g., salmeterol), antileukotrienes, and anti–immunoglobulin (Ig) E. If an oral\ncorticosteroid is needed, it is better to use prednisone rather than prednisolone because it cannot\nbe converted to the active prednisolone by the fetal liver, thus protecting the fetus from systemic\neffects of the corticosteroid. There is no contraindication to breast-feeding when patients are\nusing these drugs.\nVI-19.   The answer is C. (Chap. 310) Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is an acute respiratory syndrome\nthat often presents with a clinical picture that is difficult to differentiate from acute lung injury\nor acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinically, patients present with a prodrome of\nfevers, malaise, myalgias, night sweats, dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Physical\nexamination may demonstrate high fevers, bibasilar rales, and rhonchi. The clinical course is\nfrequently marked by rapid clinical progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure that requires\nmechanical ventilation. Chest radiography shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. This clinical\npicture clearly overlaps with infectious causes of respiratory failure and ARDS. However, the\nhallmark of acute eosinophilic pneumonia is the finding of >25% eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia most frequently presents in\nindividuals between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is more common in men. There is no\nepidemiologic link between the diagnosis and a prior history of asthma. However, several case\nreports have linked development of acute eosinophilic pneumonia to recent initiation of cigarette\nsmoking or exposure to other environmental stimuli including dust. A bronchoalveolar lavage\nshowing eosinophilia >25% is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic\npneumonia. A surgical lung biopsy is not necessary. If performed, it would demonstrate\neosinophilic infiltration with acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage. Peripheral\neosinophilia is not present acutely at disease onset, but often becomes present between day 7\nand day 30. Other organ failure is not present. The disease has a high degree of corticosteroid\nresponsiveness and a good prognosis. Initiation of therapy with corticosteroids should not be\ndelayed. Although there is no recommended dose of steroids for therapy, patients are often\ninitiated on therapy with intravenous glucocorticoids with rapid improvement in the hypoxemic\nrespiratory failure. The expected clinical course is complete resolution of clinical and\nradiographic features of the disease over several weeks without relapse upon tapering of steroids.\nVI-20.   The answer is D. (Chap. 310) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an\neosinophilic pulmonary disorder that occurs in response to allergic sensitization to antigens from\nAspergillus fungi. The classic presentation of an individual with ABPA is someone with an\nasthmatic phenotype that becomes increasingly difficult to control and may be steroid\ndependent. These individuals often complain of chronic cough with expectoration of thick brown\nmucus plugs. In addition, individuals with cystic fibrosis have an increased incidence of ABPA.\nABPA can be difficult to diagnose, and many individuals have had prolonged symptoms prior to\ndiagnosis. Initial diagnostic testing should include demonstration of elevated circulating IgE level\n(option D), typically >1000 IU/mL. Peripheral eosinophilia is also commonly seen. If the IgE\nlevel is elevated and suggestive of IgE, one must demonstrate sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens.\nThis can be achieved by skin test reactivity, positive serum precipitins for Aspergillus, and/or\ndirect measurement of circulating specific IgG and IgE to Aspergillus. Testing for specific IgE in\nthe serum is most frequent accomplished via radioallergosorbent (RAST) testing. Chest CT\n(option B) may show central bronchiectasis as the classic manifestation of ABPA but is present in\nonly about 30% of individuals. Other findings in ABPA including patchy infiltrates and mucus\nimpaction. Aspirin desensitization (option A) therapy is a treatment for aspirin-sensitive asthma\nthat characteristically presents with the Samter triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and aspirin\nand/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sensitivity. Nasal nitric oxide testing (option C) is a\ndiagnostic test used for identification of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Sweat chloride testing\n(option E) is used for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\nVI-21. and VI-22.    The answers are B and E, respectively. (Chap. 310) The patient has a subacute\npresentation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to exposure to bird droppings and feathers\nat work. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that has a\nvariety of presentations. Some people develop acute onset of shortness of breath, fevers, chills,\nand dyspnea within 6–8 hours of antigen exposure. Others may present subacutely with\nworsening dyspnea on exertion and dry cough over weeks to months. Chronic hypersensitivity\npneumonitis presents with more severe and persistent symptoms with clubbing. Progressive\nworsening is common with the development of chronic hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension,\ninterstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure. The diagnosis relies on a variety of tests.\nPeripheral eosinophilia is not a feature of this disease as the disease is mediated through T-cell\ninflammation. Other nonspecific markers of inflammation may be elevated, including the\nerythrocyte \nsedimentation \nrate, \nC-reactive \nprotein, \nrheumatoid \nfactor, \nand \nserum\nimmunoglobulins. Neutrophilia and lymphopenia can be seen. If a specific antigen is suspected,\nserum precipitins directed toward that antigen may be demonstrated. However, these tests are\nneither sensitive nor specific for the presence of disease. Chest radiography may be normal or\nshow a diffuse reticulonodular infiltrate. Chest HRCT is the imaging modality of choice and\nshows ground-glass infiltrates in the lower lobes. Centrilobular infiltrates are often seen as well.\nIn the chronic stages, patchy emphysema is the most common finding. Histopathologically,\ninterstitial alveolar infiltrates predominate, with a variety of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and\noccasionally eosinophils and neutrophils seen. Loose, noncaseating granulomas are typical.\nTreatment requires removing the individual from exposure to the antigen. If this is not possible,\nthe patient should wear a mask that prevents small-particle inhalation during exposure. In\npatients with mild disease, removal from antigen exposure alone may be sufficient to treat the\ndisease. More severe symptoms require therapy with glucocorticoids at an equivalent prednisone\ndose of 1 mg/kg daily for 7 to 14 days. The steroids are then gradually tapered over 2 to 6\nweeks.\nVI-23.   The answer is C. (Chap. 311) Mesothelioma is a rare malignancy of the pleura and peritoneum,\nwith almost all cases associated with asbestos exposure. It is notable that the exposure to\nasbestos could seem almost minimal but still confer significant risk. Exposures of less than 1–2\nyears or that have occurred more than 40 years in the past have been demonstrated to confer\nincreased risk of mesothelioma. Although tobacco smoking in association with asbestos exposure\nincreases the risk of lung cancer several-fold, there is no additive or exponential risk of\nmesothelioma in those who smoke. Mesothelioma most often presents with a persistent unilateral\npleural effusion that may mask the underlying pleural tumor. However, the pleura may be\ndiffusely thickened. Typically, large pleural effusions would cause expansion of the hemithorax\nwith mediastinal shift away from the side of the pleural effusion. However, even with large\neffusions, no mediastinal shift is seen on chest radiograph because the pleural thickening\nassociated with the disease leads to a fixed chest cavity size and thoracic restriction. The most\ndifficult diagnostic dilemma in these patients is to differentiate mesothelioma from metastatic\nlung carcinoma (usually adenocarcinoma) as many patients are at risk for both tumors, and lung\ncancer is by far the most common malignancy seen in individuals with asbestos exposure and\ncigarette smoking. Pleural fluid cytology is not adequate for the diagnosis of most individuals\nwith mesothelioma, with samples being positive for the disease in less than 50% of individuals.\nMost often, video-assisted thoracoscopy is required to directly visualize the pleural and direct\nbiopsy sampling. Unfortunately, there is no proven effective therapy for mesothelioma, and most\npatients die from local extension of the disease.\nVI-24.   The answer is E. (Chap. 311) Silicosis results from the inhalation of free silica (or crystalline\nquartz) and is associated with mining, stonecutting, foundry work, and quarrying. The chronic\nform of silicosis has been associated with an increased risk of a variety of diseases. Silica is\nknown to be cytotoxic to alveolar macrophages and, thus, places patients at increased risk of\npulmonary infections that rely on cellular immunity, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\natypical mycobacteria, and fungus. In addition, silicosis is associated with the development of\nconnective tissue disorders including rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid nodules (Caplan\nsyndrome) and scleroderma. Finally, silica is listed as a probable lung carcinogen.\nVI-25.   The answer is D. (Chap. 311) Occupational lung diseases have been associated with a wide\nvariety of organic and inorganic exposures in the workplace and clinically can range from\nprimarily an airway disease to progressive pulmonary fibrosis. When evaluating a patient for a\nnew pulmonary diagnosis, it is important to perform a detailed occupational history to determine\nif there is a possibility that the patient’s profession may be causing or perpetuating the disease\nprocess. Specific clinical syndromes are associated with well-defined clinical exposures. The\ninorganic dusts include asbestos, silica, coal dust, beryllium, and a variety of other metals.\nAsbestos and silica are among the most common exposures. Asbestos exposure is associated with\nmining, construction, and ship repair. In areas near where asbestos mining has occurred, the\ngeneral population also has shown an increased risk of asbestos-related lung disease. Clinically,\nasbestos exposure is associated with a range of clinical syndromes including asbestosis\n(interstitial lung disease), benign pleural plaques and pleural effusions, lung cancer, and\nmesothelioma. Silica exposure is common among miners, stone masons, and individuals involved\nin sand blasting or quarrying. A variety of clinical syndrome can occur with silica exposure, the\nmost severe being progressive massive fibrosis with mass-like upper lobe consolidating nodules\n(>1 cm). Coal mining is also associated with a clinical picture similar to silicosis and progressive\nmassive fibrosis. Beryllium is a lightweight metal that is highly conductive and is used in high-\ntech industries. The classic disease associated with beryllium exposure is a chronic\ngranulomatous disease similar in clinical appearance to sarcoidosis. Other metals can produce\nany number of clinical syndromes. Welders of galvanized metal who use zinc oxide are\nsusceptible to metal fume fever and present with an acute self-limited influenza-like illness.\n    Organic dusts that can lead to occupational lung disease include cotton dust, grain dust, toxic\nchemicals, and other agricultural dusts, among many others. Cotton milling and processing can\npresent with a clinical syndrome known as byssinosis, which has asthma-like features. Many of\nthe organic dust exposures also lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Examples of\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis syndromes related to occupational exposures include farmer’s lung,\npigeon breeder’s lung, and malt worker’s lung. Typically, a specific antigen can be identified as\nthe culprit for the development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In farmer’s lung, the most\ncommon cause is thermophilic Actinomyces species found in moldy hay.\nVI-26.   The answer is D. (Chap. 311) The patient presents with acute-onset pulmonary symptoms,\nincluding wheezing, with no other medical problems. He is a farmer and was recently handling\nhay. The clinical presentation and radiogram are consistent with farmer’s lung, a hypersensitivity\npneumonitis caused by Actinomyces. In this disorder, moldy hay with spores of actinomycetes are\ninhaled and produce a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The disorder is seen most commonly in\nrainy periods, when the spores multiply. Patients present generally 4–8 hours after exposure with\nfever, cough, and shortness of breath without wheezing. Chest radiograms often show patchy\nbilateral, often upper lobe infiltrates. The exposure history will differentiate this disorder from\nother types of pneumonia.\nVI-27.   The answer is D. (Chap. 311) Firefighters and fire victims are at risk of smoke inhalation\ninjury, an important cause of acute cardiorespiratory failure. In addition to the risk of carbon\nmonoxide poisoning, these individuals are also at risk from toxic inhalational injury from fumes\nreleased from the burning of synthetic materials. This patient has a carbon monoxide level that\nrequires treatment with 100% oxygen but would not be expected to lead to significant\ncardiorespiratory collapse. Recently, cyanide toxicity has been recognized as a significant cause\nof morbidity and mortality following industrial and house fires. Cyanide toxicity can present\nwith rapid development of neurologic and cardiorespiratory collapse. The neurologic symptoms\ncan range from mild headache to confusion, generalized seizures, and coma. Hypotension with\nsignificant lactic acidosis is prominent. Often an elevated lactate level leads to the suspicion of\nconcomitant cyanide toxicity in an individual with smoke inhalation injury. However to\ndefinitely make the diagnosis, one would want to assess the red blood cell cyanide concentration.\nVI-28.   The answer is D. (Chap. 312) Bronchiectasis is a common disorder that refers to an irreversible\ndilation of the airways that affects the lung in a focal or diffuse pattern. Historically,\nbronchiectasis has been characterized pathologically as cylindrical, varicose, or cystic in nature.\nThere are numerous causes of bronchiectasis including infectious, inherited, immunologic, and\nidiopathic causes. The most common cause of bronchiectasis worldwide is postinfectious\nfollowing tuberculosis infection. However, in developed countries, other causes are more\ncommon. The most common cause in developed countries is cystic fibrosis (CF); CF patients\ndevelop clinically significant bronchiectasis in late adolescence or early adulthood. Most children\nwith CF are diagnosed currently through newborn screening programs, which were introduced in\nall states within the past decade. However, adults may continue to present with milder forms of\nthe disease, so clinicians should continue to have a high degree of clinical suspicion for CF when\nan individual presents with a new diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Epidemiologically, individuals\npresenting with CF bronchiectasis will typically be younger than individuals with non-CF\nbronchiectasis. In contrast, non-CF bronchiectasis more commonly affects nonsmoking women\nolder than 50 years. The clinical presentation of bronchiectasis is a daily cough productive of\nthick tenacious sputum. Physical examination demonstrates both crackles and wheezing on\nexamination. In CF, the disease findings are more predominant in the upper lobes, whereas in\ncertain other causes (chronic aspiration, immunoglobulin deficiency), there is a lower lobe\npredominance. Clubbing is variably present and generally only seen in more advance disease.\nThe diagnosis of bronchiectasis is determined by the presence of the disease on a chest CT\nimaging. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, particularly early\nin the disease process. It may show “tram tracks” indicating dilated airway. Chest HRCT is the\ndiagnostic modality of choice for confirming diagnosis. Findings include demonstration of\ndilated, nontapering airways that may be filled with mucus. In addition, signet-ring signs may\nalso be seen where the airway is greater than 1.5 times the size of the adjacent blood vessel.\nOther findings include bronchial wall thickening, inspissated secretion with a “tree-in-bud”\npattern, and cysts emanating from the bronchial wall. Once bronchiectasis has been confirmed\non CT imaging, other tests may be indicated in this patient to determine the etiology of the\nbronchiectasis. Testing should be guided by the history and physical examination and may\ninclude sputum culture for mycobacteria and fungal organisms, immunoglobulin levels,\nautoimmune panel, sweat chloride testing, nasal nitric oxide testing (for primary ciliary\ndyskinesia), bronchoscopy, and/or tests of swallow function. Despite thorough evaluation, in as\nmany as 25%–50% of individuals referred for workup of bronchiectasis, no specific cause is ever\nidentified.\nVI-29.   The answer is C. (Chap. 312) Treatment of infectious bronchiectasis relies upon controlling the\nsource of infection and maintaining good bronchial hygiene and airway clearance. The most\ncommon nontuberculous mycobacterial organism causing infection in individuals with\nbronchiectasis is Mycobacterium avium-intracellculare (MAI or MAC). The recommended treatment\nfor MAI is a macrolide combined with ethambutol and rifampin. The recommended course of\ntherapy is 12 months after the last positive culture. In certain instances, surgical resection can be\nconsidered for focal bronchiectasis if a patient is failing to clear the infection after a prolonged\ncourse of antibiotic therapy. However, this patient has had negative cultures for 12 months,\ndemonstrating an appropriate response to antimicrobial therapy. Thus, options A and B are\nincorrect. However, the patient continues to have daily sputum expectoration related to her\nunderlying bronchiectasis and should be instructed on appropriate bronchial hygiene and airway\nclearance. A variety of approaches have been used, and no one treatment has been demonstrated\nto be superior. Chest physiotherapy is often recommended on a daily basis to improve secretion\nclearance. This can be accomplished through postural drainage often combined with traditional\nmechanical percussion or the use of devices including high-frequency chest wall oscillation vest\nor oscillatory positive expiratory pressure flutter valve (option C). Regular exercise may also\nimprove airway clearance. Mucolytic agents such as hypertonic saline are also often used.\nHowever, in contrast with CF bronchiectasis, dornase (DNase) (option D) is not used for non-CF\nbronchiectasis. A randomized, placebo-controlled research trial demonstrated lack of efficacy\nand potential harm in the non-CF population. Finally, there is no proven role for the use of daily\noral corticosteroids (option E) in the absence of a disease known to respond to steroid therapy,\nsuch as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or autoimmune disease such as Sjögren\nsyndrome.\nVI-30 and VI-31.    The answers are B and B, respectively. (Chap. 313) Cystic fibrosis is one of the\nmost common life-shortening autosomal recessive disorders, affecting about 1 in 3300 live births\nin Caucasians. It is much less common in African Americans (~1 in 15,000) and Asians (~1 in\n33,000). The disease is caused by an inherited defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane\nregulator (CFTR) protein, a large ion channel in the cell membrane responsible for chloride ion\ntransport. In the absence of a functional CFTR protein, individuals with CF have a variety of\ndisease manifestations related to impaired exocrine function. The primary disease manifestations\nare respiratory and pancreatic in nature with chronic sinopulmonary infections, impaired\nexocrine pancreatic function, and poor nutrition. The gene that encodes CFTR is located on\nchromosome 7, and more than 2000 mutations have been described. In understanding the\ngenetics, it is best to categorize them according to the effect on CFTR function. Class I mutations\n(G542X, 621+1G>T) lead to absence of synthesis, most frequently through the presence of an\nabnormal stop codon. Class II mutations (F508del, the most common mutation) cause defective\nprotein synthesis and premature degradation. Class III mutations (G551D) are gating mutations,\nin which the CFTR protein is present at the cell membrane but fails to function properly. Type IV\nmutations (R117H, R117C) are conductance mutations with impaired conductance through the\nion channel pore, and Type V mutations are splice mutations that lead to a diminished number\nof CFTR transcripts being produced due to a promoter or splicing abnormality. One of the most\nexciting breakthroughs in the treatment of CF has been in the area of CFTR modulations. High-\nthroughput screening identified small-molecule compounds that act as potentiators or correctors\nof CFTR and improve CFTR function. The first of these compounds to be identified was ivacaftor.\nThis drug works as a potentiator and has been approved for individuals with gating mutations,\nthe most common of which is G551D. Approximately 5% of the CF population has a gating\nmutation. In clinical trials, individuals with a G551D mutation treated with ivacaftor\nexperienced an absolute improvement in lung function (FEV1 percent predicted) of 10.6% and a\ndecline in sweat chloride values to normal levels. This was sustained over the 24 weeks of the\nclinical trial. Long-term data are now available that demonstrates persistent effects of ivacaftor\nup to 144 weeks (McKone EF et al: Lancet Respir Med 2014;2(11):902–910). Individuals on\nivacaftor also experience an improvement in nutritional status and growth in younger\nindividuals as well. Ivacaftor is now being combined with corrector compounds such as\nlumacaftor to attempt to correct the F508del processing abnormality. The combination of\nivacaftor and lumacaftor was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July\n2015 for individuals homozygous for F508del. Other potentiator/corrector combinations are\nundergoing clinical trials.\nVI-32.   The answer is E. (Chap. 313 and J Pediatr 2008;153(2):S4–S14) CF is a common autosomal\nrecessive disorder that affects 1 out of every 3300 live births in the Caucasian population of\nNorth America and Europe. There have been more than 2000 mutations identified in the gene\nfor the CFTR protein—the abnormal protein identified in CF. This protein is a large\ntransmembrane protein involved in the transport of chloride and other ions, and abnormalities of\nthe CFTR lead to abnormalities of salt and water transport. The primary clinical manifestations\nof CF are due to the effects of the mutated CFTR in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and\npancreas. In the lungs, abnormal CFTR leads to thick, sticky mucus with abnormal mucociliary\nclearance. A patient will have recurrent respiratory infections with development of cystic\nbronchiectasis over time. The presenting manifestation in infancy is often meconium ileus and\ncan lead to constipation and distal intestinal obstruction in adults. Failure of the CFTR in the\npancreas prevents appropriate release of pancreatic enzymes to allow for proper digestion of\nfood, especially fatty foods, with resultant malnutrition and steatorrhea. While most patients\nwith CF present in infancy or childhood, about 5% of all individuals with CF will not be\ndiagnosed until adulthood. Presenting symptoms in adulthood can be myriad and often result\nfrom minor mutations of the CFTR gene. These symptoms can include recurrent lung and sinus\ninfections, malnutrition, sinus disease, and infertility, especially absence of the vas deferens in\nmen. The standard test for the diagnosis of CF is the sweat chloride test. Elevated values are\npathognomonic for CF, with a cutoff of >60 mmol/L in adults being diagnostic. Values greater\nthan 40 mmol/L fall within the indeterminate range. Given the large number of mutations that\ncan cause CF, genetic testing can be expensive and is not the first test performed when CF is\nsuspected. A screening CF genetic panel often only identifies between approximately 20 and 80\nof the common CF mutations. If only one mutation is identified, then this may represent the\ncarrier state, or it could represent CF with a more rare mutation requiring more detailed genetic\nanalysis, including full gene sequencing. In such cases, referral to a tertiary CF care center is\nhelpful for data interpretation. In some instances, nasal potential difference testing can be\nhelpful because CF patients demonstrate an elevated baseline nasal potential difference with\nfailure to respond to stimulation with β-agonists. Presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common\nin adults with CF but is not specific for the diagnosis of the disease because bronchiectasis from\nany cause can lead to P aeruginosa colonization.\nVI-33.   The answer is C. (Chap. 313 and Ann Am Thorac Soc 2014;11(10):1640–1650) Individuals with\nCF experience recurrent pulmonary and sinus infections. In childhood, the most commonly\nisolated organisms are Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. However, over time,\nmost adults demonstrate P aeruginosa. It is now recognized that chronic colonization with\nPseudomonas, especially multidrug-resistant organisms, is associated with a more rapid decline in\nlung function. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends quarterly office visits with a\nphysician with assessment of respiratory cultures at each visit. When Pseudomonas is initially\ndetected, attempts to eradicate the organism should be undertaken. The recommended regimen\nfor eradication is an inhaled antibiotic with the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin as the\npreferred agent. This will be continued every other month until the next office visit to determine\nif therapy should be continued. For all patients chronically colonized with Pseudomonas, inhaled\ntobramycin every other month should be continued on an indefinite basis. In addition,\nazithromycin 500 mg three times weekly or 250 mg daily is also used. Whether azithromycin\nprimarily exerts its beneficial effect through anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial actions is not\ndefinitively known at the present time. Because the patient is clinically well without any\nsymptoms of acute exacerbation, the use of intravenous antibiotics is not required. Chest wall\noscillation and hypertonic saline are both mechanisms to improve airway clearance. While the\npatient may need to improve airway clearance in the future, the most important component of\nhis care at present is to eradicate new growth of Pseudomonas. His current exercise regimen and\nautogenic drainage provide a component of airway clearance in his maintenance care plan.\nVI-34.   The answer is D. (Chap. 314) Acute exacerbations of COPD are a frequent cause of morbidity\nand mortality in COPD, contributing to >70% of healthcare expenditures for COPD. Risk factors\nfor development of acute exacerbation include severity of airflow obstruction (FEV1 <50%\npredicted), history of prior exacerbations, and elevated ratio of pulmonary artery to aorta on\nchest CT. Acute exacerbations of COPD cost over $10 billion to the healthcare system in the\nUnited States annually. Thus, determining the causes of exacerbations and prevention of future\nexacerbations have been important targets in the care of COPD patients. Most acute\nexacerbations are associated with airway inflammation or infection, including acquiring a new\nstrain of bacteria or a viral respiratory infection. Therefore, strategies for prevention have been\nprimarily focused on decreasing inflammatory responses and preventing infections. The selective\nphosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast has been demonstrated to decrease exacerbation\nfrequency in individuals with COPD who have symptoms of chronic bronchitis and frequent\nexacerbations. However, it has limited effects of pulmonary function and chronic respiratory\nsymptoms. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has both anti-inflammatory and antibiotic\nproperties. In a randomized controlled trial, it has been shown to decrease exacerbation\nfrequency and increase time to first exacerbation when administered at a dose of 500 mg daily,\nnot 250 mg three times weekly. Other interventions that also decrease exacerbation frequency\ninclude use of inhaled glucocorticoids in individuals with frequent exacerbations or asthmatic\nsymptoms and influenza vaccination. Long-acting anticholinergic medications and long-acting β-\nagonists decrease exacerbations as well. Oxygen therapy and nocturnal ventilation are not\nindicated for prevention of exacerbations. Theophylline yields modest improvements in lung\nfunction but has no proven effect on exacerbations.\nVI-35.   The answer is D. (Chap. 314) COPD affects more than 10 million Americans and is currently\nthe fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Worldwide, COPD is also increasing as\ncigarette smoking, the primary risk factor for the development of COPD, is increasing in\nprevalence throughout the world. While cigarette smoking is clearly identified as a risk factor for\nCOPD, other factors have also been identified to contribute to the risk of COPD. In many\ndeveloping countries, the prevalence of smoking among women remains low. However, the\nincidence of COPD is increasing in women as well as men. In many developing countries, this\nincreased incidence of COPD in women is attributable to the use of biomass fuels in poorly\nventilated areas for heat and cooking. In addition, passive cigarette smoke exposure may also\ncontribute. Occupational exposures also lead to an increased risk of COPD. Although some\nexposures such as cotton textile dust and gold mining have not been definitively associated with\nCOPD, coal dust exposure is a risk factor for emphysema in both smokers and nonsmokers.\nInherent properties of the airways also affect the risk of COPD. Airway hyperresponsiveness\nincreases the risk of lung function decline and is a risk factor for COPD. Although there is much\ninterest in the role of chronic or recurrent infections as a risk factor for COPD, there has been no\nproven link.\nVI-36.   The answer is B. (Chap. 314) COPD is a disease process encompassing the clinical entities of\nemphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is defined pathophysiologically by the presence of\nirreversible airflow obstruction with hyperinflation and impaired gas exchange. The airflow\nobstruction occurs for several reasons including decreased elastic recoil of the lungs, increased\nairway inflammation, and increased closure of small airways due to loss of tethering in\nemphysematous lungs. This leads to early closure of airways in expiration with air trapping and\nhyperinflation. Finally, the loss of alveoli in emphysematous lungs leads to a progressive decline\nin gas exchange with alterations of ventilation-perfusion relationships. On pulmonary function\ntesting, these pathophysiologic changes result in a typical pattern with the primary characteristic\nof COPD being a decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1. The severity of airflow obstruction is\ngraded by the degree of decline in the percent predicted FEV1. The FVC may or may not be\ndecreased. With hyperinflation, the TLC increases with a concomitant increase in RV. Finally, the\nDLCO is also characteristically decreased in most cases of COPD. Some patients with pure\nchronic bronchitis without any emphysematous component may have a preserved DLCO,\nalthough this is a rare presentation for COPD. This same pattern of pulmonary function testing\ncan be seen in asthma with the exception of the DLCO, which is typically normal asthma. A\ndecrease in TLC is characteristic in restrictive ventilator disorders, such as pulmonary fibrosis,\nbut not in obstructive disorders such as COPD.\nVI-37.   The answer is D. (Chap. 314) This patient has a known diagnosis of COPD, with worsening\nsymptoms and pulmonary function testing consistent with a moderate degree of disease. By the\nGlobal Initiative for Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria, the patient would have stage II disease. He is\ncurrently undermanaged with a short-acting β-agonist only in the setting of limiting symptoms.\nUnfortunately, there is no medical therapy that alters mortality or definitively decreases rate of\ndecline in lung function in COPD with the exception of smoking cessation, oxygen for chronic\nhypoxemia, and lung volume reduction surgery in a small subset of highly selected patients.\nTherefore, the goal of therapy in COPD is to improve symptoms and quality of life. The best\ninitial medication for this patient would be to add a long-acting bronchodilator in the form of\nthe antimuscarinic agent tiotropium. In large randomized controlled trials, tiotropium has been\ndemonstrated to improve symptoms and decrease exacerbations in COPD. Ipratropium, a short-\nacting anticholinergic medication, also improves symptoms but has not been similarly shown to\ndecrease exacerbation rate. Combinations of long-acting β-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids\nhave also been shown to decrease exacerbations and improve quality of life in COPD. The largest\ntrial of these medications to date has demonstrated a trend toward improved mortality.\nCurrently, the recommendation for initiation of long-acting β-agonist and inhaled glucocorticoid\ncombinations is to consider starting the medication if the patient has two or more exacerbations\nyearly or demonstrates significant acute bronchodilator reactivity on pulmonary function testing.\nAt one time, physicians considered prescribing long-term oral glucocorticoids if a patient\ndemonstrated significant improvement in lung function in response to a trial of oral steroids.\nHowever, long-term treatment with steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio including\nweight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infection, especially pneumonia. Oxygen therapy\nimproves outcomes in individuals who are hypoxemic at rest or have borderline hypoxemia with\nevidence of end-organ damage (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, polycythemia). Although oxygen\nmay be prescribed for individuals with isolated exercise or nocturnal hypoxemia, research to\ndate has not demonstrated any change in outcomes with oxygen in these settings.\nVI-38.   The answer is E. (Chap. 314) Acute exacerbations of COPD are marked by an increase in\ndyspnea, an increase in sputum, and a change in sputum color. Acute exacerbations of COPD\naccount for more than $10 billion in healthcare expenditures annually in the United States, with\nsignificant morbidity and mortality associated with these exacerbations. Prompt treatment can\nimprove symptoms and decrease hospitalizations and mortality in this setting. In patients\npresenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of an acute exacerbation, the\ntreatment that has demonstrated the strongest reduction in mortality, when compared to\ntraditional mechanical ventilation, is noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). NIPPV\nalso decreases the need for endotracheal intubation, complications, and length of stay in the\nhospital. Antibiotics, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids are all cornerstones of therapy in the\ntreatment of acute exacerbations in COPD but have not been demonstrated in clinical trials to\nhave similar mortality benefits in the situation of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.\nSpecifically, no benefit is demonstrated for intravenous versus oral corticosteroids. Likewise, the\nchoice of antibiotic should be made based on local susceptibility patterns, and need for broad-\nspectrum antibiotics that cover for Pseudomonas is not typically indicated. Recent studies have\ndemonstrated that high-flow nasal oxygen may be an effective alternative to NIPPV, with\nimproved outcomes (need for mechanical ventilation) and improved patient comfort.\nVI-39.   The answer is C. (Chap. 314) The only therapies that have been proven to improve survival in\npatients with COPD are smoking cessation, oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia, and lung\nvolume reduction surgery in a very small subset of highly selected patients. This patient\nprobably has resting hypoxemia resulting from the presence of an elevated jugular venous pulse,\npedal edema, and elevated hematocrit. Theophylline has been shown to increase exercise\ntolerance in patients with COPD through a mechanism other than bronchodilation. Oral\nglucocorticoids are not indicated in the absence of an acute exacerbation and may lead to\ncomplications if they are used indiscriminately. Atenolol and enalapril have no specific role in\ntherapy for COPD but are often used when there is concomitant hypertension or cardiovascular\ndisease.\nVI-40 and VI-41.   The answers are E and C, respectively. (Chap. 315 and Am J Respir Crit Care Med\n2015;192(2):238–248) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common cause of\nidiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The disease typically presents with progressive dyspnea on\nexertion and dry cough in an older individual. IPF is rare in individuals younger than age 50\nyears. On physical examination, inspiratory crackles and clubbing are common. Pulmonary\nfunction tests demonstrate restrictive ventilatory defect (low TLC, low RV, low VC) with a low\nDLCO. As in the chest HRCT shown, there is typically interstitial fibrosis that is worse in the\nbases and begins in the subpleural areas, often associated with traction bronchiectasis and\nhoneycombing. Atypical findings that should cause one to consider an alternative diagnosis\ninclude the presence of ground-glass infiltrates, nodular opacities, an upper lobe predominance\nof disease, and prominent hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopic biopsy is\ninsufficient for histologic confirmation, and a surgical lung biopsy is required for definitive\ndiagnosis. The histologic hallmark of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia, but can also occur in\nrheumatologic diseases or due to secondary exposures. In these cases, the prognosis is better\nthan when the diagnosis is IPF. If no other secondary cause is identified, the diagnosis of IPF is\ngiven. The natural history of IPF is one of continued progression of disease and a high mortality\nrate. Acute exacerbations also occur with a rapid progression of symptoms associated with a\npattern of diffuse ground-glass opacities on CT. These are associated with a high mortality. Until\nrecently, no treatment had been demonstrated to slow progression of disease. Recently, two\ntherapies have been approved by the FDA for treatment of IPF—nintedanib and pirfenidone (Am\nJ Respir Crit Care Med 2015;192(2):238–248). Nintedanib is an intracellular tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor that inhibits several growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor,\nfibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. A recent trial demonstrated that use\nof this medication slowed the rate of decline in FVC and could potentially decrease mortality.\nPirfenidone is an oral antifibrotic medication that has been demonstrated to decrease fibroblast\nproliferation and collagen synthesis. It too has also been shown to decrease decline in FVC and\npotentially decrease mortality. Therapies that have been shown to not benefit in IPF include\nglucocorticoids, immunosuppressant agents, and N-acetylcysteine. Referral for lung CT should be\nconsidered in all patients with a diagnosis of IPF due to the unpredictability of the diagnosis.\nVI-42.   The answer is C. (Chap. 315) In many cases of interstitial lung disease, bronchoscopy can offer\nsome clues to the cause of the disease. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a pathologic process that\ncan occur in many diseases including vasculitis, Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus\nerythematosus, crack cocaine use, mitral stenosis, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis,\namong many others. On bronchoscopy, one would expect to see a progressively greater blood\nreturn on sequential aliquots of lavage fluid. Microscopic examination would show hemosiderin-\nladen macrophages and red blood cells. Atypical hyperplastic type II pneumocytes are seen in\ndiffuse alveolar damage or cases of drug toxicity. Ferruginous bodies and dust particles are found\nin asbestos-related pulmonary disease. Lymphocytosis is common in hypersensitivity\npneumonitis and sarcoidosis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has a low CD4:CD8 ratio, whereas\nsarcoidosis has an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in pulmonary\nalveolar proteinosis has a milky appearance with foamy macrophages.\nVI-43 and VI-44.    The answers are E and E, respectively. (Chap. 315) Pulmonary alveolar\nproteinosis is a rare disorder that usually presents between ages 30 and 50 years. It is slightly\nmore common in men. Three distinct subtypes have been described: congenital, acquired, and\nsecondary (most frequently caused by acute silicosis or hematologic malignancies). Interestingly,\nthe pathogenesis of the disease has been associated with antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage\ncolony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in most cases of acquired disease in adults. The pathobiology\nof the disease is failure of clearance of pulmonary surfactant. These patients typically present\nwith subacute dyspnea on exertion with fatigue and low-grade fevers. Associated laboratory\nabnormalities \ninclude \npolycythemia, \nhypergammaglobulinemia, \nand \nincreased \nlactate\ndehydrogenase levels. Elevated serum levels of lung surfactant proteins A and D have been\ndescribed, and autoantibodies to GM-CSF can be found in both the serum and bronchoalveolar\nlavage fluid. Classically, the CT appearance is described as “crazy pavement” with ground-glass\nalveolar infiltrates in a perihilar distribution and intervening areas of normal lung.\nBronchoalveolar lavage is diagnostic, with large amounts of amorphous proteinaceous material\nseen. Macrophages filled with periodic acid-Schiff–positive material are also frequently seen. The\ntreatment of choice is whole-lung lavage through a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Survival at\n5 years is higher than 95%, although some patients will need a repeat whole-lung lavage.\nTreatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with GM-CSF remains experimental.\nVI-45.   The answer is D. (Chap. 315) This patient is presenting with subacute pulmonary symptoms,\nintermittent fevers, myalgias, and malaise. The biopsy shows a pattern of cryptogenic organizing\npneumonia (COP). COP (formerly bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) usually\npresents in the fifth or sixth decades with a flulike illness. Symptoms include fevers, malaise,\nweight loss, cough, and dyspnea. Inspiratory crackles are common, and late inspiratory squeaks\nmay also be heard. Pulmonary function testing reveals restrictive lung disease. The typical\npattern on chest HRCT is patchy areas of airspace consolidation, nodular opacities, and ground-\nglass opacities that occur more frequently in the lower lung zones. Pathology shows the presence\nof granulation tissue plugging airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. There is frequently chronic\ninflammation in the alveolar interstitium. Treatment with high-dose steroids is effective in two-\nthirds of individuals, with most individuals being able to be tapered to lower doses over the first\nyear. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive therapy that is commonly used in interstitial lung\ndisease due to usual interstitial pneumonitis. While it may be considered in COP unresponsive to\nglucocorticoids, it would not be a first-line agent used without concomitant steroid therapy.\nBecause most patients with COP respond to corticosteroids, referral for lung transplantation is\nnot required unless there is a failure to respond to therapy. Nintedanib and pirfenidone are\ntreatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nVI-46.   The answer is C. (Chap. 316) Empyema refers to the presence of a grossly purulent pleural\neffusion, which is present in this clinical scenario. The management of an empyema requires\nplacement of a chest tube for drainage, and a recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial\ndemonstrated improved outcomes with use of both alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator) and\ndeoxyribonuclease (DNase) twice daily for 3 days beginning within the first day after chest tube\nplacement. The trial was conducted using a factorial design comparing the combination therapy\nto placebo and to either therapy alone. The combination of alteplase and DNase showed\nimproved resolution of pleural fluid, shorter duration of hospital stay, and lesser need for\nsurgical intervention when compared to placebo or either therapy alone (Rahman NM et al: N\nEngl J Med 2011;365:518–526).\nVI-47.   The answer is C. (Chap. 316) Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening complication that\nmust be rapidly recognized and alleviated. If undetected, it will rapidly progress to\ncardiovascular collapse and death. Tension pneumothorax most commonly occurs during\nmechanical ventilation and during resuscitative efforts. An initial sign during mechanical\nventilation is high peak inspiratory pressures or difficulty with ventilation. Hypotension and\nhypoxemia are signs of impending cardiovascular collapse and are caused by decreased venous\nreturn to the heart and reduced cardiac output. The physical examination may show absence of\nbreath sounds on the affected side with enlargement of the hemithorax, hyperresonance to\npercussion, and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. A chest radiograph would be\nconfirmatory, but in an acute setting, there may not be time to obtain the testing. If clinical\nsuspicion is high, treatment should not be delayed as tension pneumothorax is a medical\nemergency and the patient is likely to die if the tension is not relieved. A large-bore needle\nshould be placed into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space. If a large\namount of air escapes after the needle is inserted, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should\nremain in place until definitive treatment with a tube thoracostomy can be performed.\nVI-48.   The answer is E. (Chap. 316) Parapneumonic effusions are one of the most common causes of\nthe exudative pleural effusion. When an effusion is identified in association with pneumonia, it is\nprudent to perform a thoracentesis if the fluid can be safely accessed. One way to know whether\nthere is enough fluid for thoracentesis is to perform a lateral decubitus film and observe if there\nis free-flowing fluid at a volume of >10 mm from the chest wall. However, if the fluid does not\nlayer, this may indicate a complex loculated fluid. A loculated effusion often indicates an\ninfected effusion and may require chest tube drainage or surgical intervention. Other factors that\nare associated with the need for more invasive procedures include pleural fluid pH <7.20,\npleural fluid glucose <60 mg/dL (<3.3 mmol/L), positive Gram stain or culture of the pleural\nfluid, and presence of gross pus in the pleural space (empyema). Fluid recurrence following\ninitial thoracentesis does indicate a complicated pleural effusion, but a repeat thoracentesis\nshould be performed to ensure no concerning features have developed.\nVI-49.   The answer is A. (Chap. 316) The characteristics of the pleural fluid in this patient are\nconsistent with an exudate by Light’s criteria. These criteria are as follows: pleural fluid\nprotein/serum protein ratio >0.5, pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/serum LDH ratio\n>0.6, and pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper limit of normal serum values. If\none of the criteria is met, then the effusion would be classified as an exudate. This patient clearly\nmeets the criteria for an exudate. Exudative pleural effusions occur when there are alterations in\nthe local environment that change the formation and absorption of pleural fluid. The most\ncommon causes of exudative pleural effusion are infection and malignancy. Other less common\ncauses include pulmonary embolism, chylothorax, autoimmune diseases, asbestos exposure, drug\nreactions, hemothorax, and following cardiac surgery or other cardiac injury, among others.\nUnfortunately, 25% of transudative effusions can be incorrectly identified as exudates by these\ncriteria. Most often, this occurs when the effusion has an increased number of cells to cause an\nelevation in the LDH or has been treated with diuretics to cause an increase in pleural fluid\nprotein. Transudative effusions are most often caused by heart failure, but can also be seen in\ncirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and myxedema.\nVI-50.   The answer is B. (Chap. 316) A primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of\ntrauma to the thorax. Most individuals who present with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax\nare young, and primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs almost exclusively in cigarette\nsmokers, the primary risk factor. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is also more common in\nmen and has been associated with a tall, thin body habitus. The primary cause is the rupture of\nsmall apical pleural blebs or cysts, and the CT scan of the chest is often normal. About half of\nindividuals will experience more than one primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The initial\ntreatment is simple needle aspiration, which is most commonly done with ultrasound or CT\nguidance. Oxygen is given simultaneously to speed resorption of the residual air in the pleural\nspace. If conservative treatment fails, tube thoracostomy can be performed. Pneumothoraces that\nfail to resolve or are recurrent often require thoracoscopy with stapling of blebs and pleural\nabrasion, a treatment that is effective in almost 100% of cases.\nVI-51.   The answer is B. (Chap. 317) Chronic fibrosing mediastinitis most commonly occurs after\ngranulomatous inflammation in the lymph nodes in the mediastinum that leads to an exuberant\ncalcification response. Over time, the inflammation can cause significant disruption to the vital\nstructures that course through the mediastinum and lead to the clinical symptoms of fibrosing\nmediastinitis. The most common causes of fibrosing mediastinitis are histoplasmosis and\ntuberculosis. Other causes include sarcoidosis, silicosis, or other fungal diseases. Symptoms are\nrelated to compression of mediastinal structures including the superior vena cava, pulmonary\narteries or veins, or large airway compression. The phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerves may\nalso become paralyzed. The most common symptom is dyspnea on exertion. Patients may also\ndevelop chronic cough with lithoptysis or hemoptysis due to erosion of the calcific lymph nodes\ninto airways. Patients may describe lithoptysis as gritty or sandy sputum. Hemoptysis can be\nlarge volume and may necessitate surgical intervention for control. However, other than\nantituberculous therapy for tuberculous mediastinitis, no medical or surgical therapy has any\neffectiveness on the treatment of fibrosing mediastinitis. This patient most likely has\nhistoplasmosis as the cause of her disease because histoplasmosis is endemic in Indiana. Because\nthe fibrosing mediastinitis is a sequela of an old infection, the urine Histoplasma antigen test\nwould not yield a positive result.\nVI-52.   The answer is E. (Chap. 318) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a disorder of chronic\nhypoventilation that has an unknown prevalence as no large population studies have been\nconducted. However, the prevalence is expected to increase as the prevalence of obesity is rising\nworldwide. OHS requires a body mass index >30 kg/m2 and the presence of chronic alveolar\nhypoventilation for diagnosis, with a daytime awake PaCO2 ≥45 mmHg. In more than 90% of\ncases, concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also present. The pathogenesis of OHS is not\nfully understood, although it is known that there is a downregulation of the central respiratory\ndrive in response to carbon dioxide. Multiple physiologic factors acting together likely lead to\nthis including OSA, increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle impairment, V/Q\nmismatching, and depressed central chemo-responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Most\npatients present with daytime sleepiness, headaches, and symptoms typical of OSA. These\npatients should be treated with weight loss and positive airway pressure therapy. Sustained\nweight loss will lead to improvements in PaCO2 over time. Continuous positive airway pressure\n(CPAP) therapy does lead to improvement in daytime hypercapnia and hypoxemia in more than\nhalf of patients with OHS and OSA but is not recommended for use if patients have sustained\nhypoxemia after resolution of obstructive apneic events. In these individuals bilevel positive\nairway pressure (BiPAP) therapy is used. BiPAP is also used if a patient cannot tolerate the\ntypically high levels of CPAP required for treatment. Some patients with OHS may present\nacutely with decompensated symptoms of right heart failure and respiratory failure as in this\nscenario. When a patient presents in acute decompensated OHS, BiPAP is the treatment of choice\nacutely as well. Even in patients who have previously failed home noninvasive therapy, this\nremains the treatment of choice for their acute condition and may prevent intubation and\nmechanical ventilation. The PHOX2b gene mutation plays no role in OHS but is associated with\ncongenital central hypoventilation syndromes.\nVI-53.   The answer is E. (Chap. 318) Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often develop\nhypoventilation due to involvement of their respiratory pump muscles (e.g., diaphragm,\nintercostal muscles, sternocleidomastoids). NIPPV has been used successfully in the therapy of\npatients with hypoventilation such as ALS. Nocturnal NIPPV can improve daytime hypercapnia,\nprolong survival, and improve health-related quality of life. Current ALS guidelines are to\ninstitute NIPPV if symptoms of hypoventilation exist and PaCO2 is ≥45 mmHg, nocturnal\ndesaturation to <89% is documented for 5 consecutive minutes, maximal inspiratory pressure is\n<60 cmH2O, or FVC is <50% predicted. Symptoms of hypoventilation are not particular to ALS\nand may include the following: dyspnea during activities of daily living, orthopnea in diseases\nthat affect diaphragm function, poor-quality sleep, daytime hypersomnolence, early morning\nheadaches, anxiety, and impaired cough in neuromuscular disease.\nVI-54.   The answer is B. (Chap. 319) Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a\ncommon condition estimated to affect up to 2%–15% of middle-aged individuals and >20% of\nelderly individuals and is associated with repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep.\nThis patient exhibits multiple risk factors and gives a strong history to support a diagnosis of\nOSAHS, placing him at high risk to have moderate to severe OSAHS. The greatest risk factor the\npatient has that places him at high risk for disease is obesity. Approximately 40%–60% of cases\nof OSAHS are attributable to excess body weight. The second major risk factor for OSAHS is\nmale sex because men are two to four times more likely to have OSAHS than women. The\nreasons men develop more OSAHS include greater central obesity and relatively longer\npharyngeal length, which in turn contribute to greater upper airway collapsibility. In addition,\nfemale sex hormones provide a stabilizing effect on the upper airway and stimulate ventilatory\ndrive. Thus, premenopausal women are relatively protected from OSAHS at comparable levels of\nobesity when compared to men. Other risk factors that this patient has include a positive family\nhistory of the disease and hypertension. Other common risk factors for OSAHS in the general\npopulation include craniofacial abnormalities, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, various endocrine\nsyndromes (acromegaly, hypothyroidism), increasing age, and some ethnic groups. For instance,\nindividuals of Asian descent often develop OSAHS at a lower range of body mass index, most\nlikely due to ethnic difference in craniofacial structure. In addition, individuals of African\nAmerican race are at higher risk of OSAHS when compared to whites. This patient also gives\nmany symptoms that are concerning for OSAHS including loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and\ndaytime sleepiness. Given that there is a high clinical suspicion of disease, home sleep testing\nwill likely be adequate for diagnosis of disease in this patient. Home sleep tests can be performed\nin a variety of ways, but most will record respiratory effort, nasal flow, and oxygen saturation. In\na patient with a high suspicion of disease, these tests can be a cost-efficient means of diagnosis.\nHowever, the home tests may yield false-negative results because these tests do not measure the\nelectroencephalogram, and thus, no accurate measure of sleep time is obtained. Therefore, the\nrespiratory events are determined based on total recording time rather than total sleep time. If a\npatient is awake during much of the recording time, this could cause a false-negative result. An\nattended in-lab polysomnogram remains the gold standard for diagnosis OSAHS but is\nsignificantly more expensive. In this individual with a high pretest suspicion of disease, the cost\nwould not be justified. An overnight oximetry provides only oxygen levels and heart rate and is\nnot adequate for diagnosis of OSAHS. Treatment with a CPAP device may be recommended after\na diagnosis is confirmed, but this would not be the next step in the treatment of the patient. The\npatient has only minimally enlarged tonsils. A tonsillectomy would not be expected to alleviate\nhis symptoms.\nVI-55.   The answer is E. (Chap. 319) There are numerous benefits to treating OSAHS, and the\nconsequences of untreated OSAHS are numerous and can be severe. They primarily fall in one of\nthree categories: neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic. The neurocognitive effects are\nthe ones most readily identified by the patient and include daytime sleepiness and inability to\nconcentrate. In addition, individuals with untreated OSAHS have an increased risk of depression,\nparticularly somatic depression with irritability, fatigue, and lack of energy. Moreover, untreated\nOSAHS increases the risk of occupational accidents by more than twofold and automobile\naccidents by as much as sevenfold. In addition to the neurocognitive effects, untreated OSA leads\nto increased sympathetic nervous system activity and increased systemic inflammatory\nresponses. This leads to a loss of the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. However, treatment\nwith CPAP can reduce 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, although the overall effect on blood\npressure is modest, decreasing the blood pressure about by 2–4 mmHg. Other cardiovascular and\nmetabolic effects include an increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure with and\nwithout reduced ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, stroke, and\ndiabetes. Treatment with CPAP yields improvements in insulin resistance, decreases the\nrecurrence rate of atrial fibrillation, and reduces several biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.\nVI-56.   The answer is E. (Chap. 319) Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of central sleep apnea\nassociated with hypocapnia and demonstrates a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of breathing.\nPathophysiologically, this occurs because the baseline carbon dioxide during wakefulness is\nbelow the apneic threshold during sleep. Thus, at sleep onset, a central apneic event occurs\nallowing carbon dioxide to rise. When this rise in carbon dioxide is detected centrally, there is an\nexaggerated respiratory response that leads to hyperpnea and hyperventilation, driving the\ncarbon dioxide levels below the apneic threshold again, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of\napnea and hyperpnea. It occurs more commonly in individuals with heart failure or atrial\nfibrillation due to a delay in circulation time. This prolonged circulation delay between the\npulmonary capillaries and the central carbon dioxide–sensing chemoreceptors contributes to\nthese ongoing cycles of hyperpnea and apnea. In many individuals with Cheyne-Stokes\nrespiration, it has been observed that the pattern of breathing may worsen over the course of the\nnight and the fluid is redistributed centrally, further prolonging circulation time.\nVI-57.   The answer is A. (Chap. 319) The treatment of choice for most adults with OSAHS is nasal\nCPAP. CPAP delivers a set pressure that is sufficient to overcome the tendency of the posterior\noropharynx to collapse. This pressure ranges generally from 5–15 cmH2O, although pressures as\nhigh as 20 cmH2O can be used. However, the rates of adherence to CPAP therapy are highly\nvariable. Many patients complain of claustrophobia, nasal congestion, aerophagia, or facial pain.\nIf tolerated, there is a large body of data demonstrating beneficial effects of CPAP on blood\npressure, alertness, mood, and insulin sensitivity, and likely improvement in cardiovascular\noutcomes. Oral appliance therapy is generally considered second-line therapy in mild to\nmoderate OSA if the patient fails to tolerate CPAP. It can be prescribed as initial therapy if the\npatient prefers. In most studies, the improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index with oral\nappliance is ≥50% in about two-thirds of individuals. Side effects of oral appliances include\ntemporomandibular joint pain and tooth movement. Surgical interventions for OSAHS in adults\nhave provided less than desired benefits, and it can be difficult to determine which patients will\nderive \nthe \ngreatest \nbenefits \nin \nthe \nabsence \nof \na \nknown \nanatomic \nabnormality.\nUvulopalatopharyngoplasty is the most common surgical procedure over the past two decades\nand is associated with a success rate similar to oral appliance therapy. Weight loss is generally\nrecommended for all patients with OSAHS but should not be the only therapy recommended for\nan individual with this degree of OSAHS. Supplemental oxygen can improve oxygen saturation,\nbut there is little evidence that it improves OSAHS symptoms and the apnea-hypopnea index.\nVI-58.   The answer is D. (Chap. 320e) Common indications for lung transplantation include COPD,\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, CF, emphysema, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (Table VI-\n58). Five-year survival is similar for all indications for lung transplantation at approximately\n50%. For most indications, double lung transplantation is the preferred procedure, and it is\nmandatory for patients with suppurative lung disease like CF. In general, in patients with\nidiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, double lung transplantation is preferred because of\nconcern of overcirculation in the low-resistance vascular bed transplanted lung when a native\nlung is present with markedly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. It is rare for the primary\ndisease to recur after transplantation, and this has not been described in idiopathic pulmonary\narterial hypertension. The right ventricle is highly plastic and will generally recover function\nafter elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is removed by lung transplantation. Subsequently,\nit is rare to perform heart-lung transplantation in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients\nunless there is concomitant complex congenital heart disease that cannot be repaired at the time\nof lung transplantation.\nTALBLE VI-58   Disease-Specific Guidelines for Referral and Transplantation\nVI-59.   The answer is A. (Chap. 320e) The long-term complications of lung transplantation are\nmultisystem and range from the diseases that affect the lung and are complications of a foreign\nbody in the chest to distant organ disease, either due to infections or complications of\nimmunosuppressive therapy. Although osteoporosis, posttransplantation lymphoproliferative\ndisorders, and chronic kidney disease are important complications of steroids, calcineurin\ninhibitors, and other agents used for immunosuppression, the major complications after\ntransplantation are in the lung. Primary graft dysfunction is a form of acute lung injury\nimmediately after lung transplantation that is relatively rare, with severe disease occurring in\nonly 10%–20% of cases. Airway complications such as anastomotic dehiscence or stenosis have\nsimilar occurrence rates, but can usually be managed bronchoscopically with good survival.\nRejection of transplanted organ is very common and is the main limitation to better medium-\nand long-term outcomes. Rejection occurs as acute cellular rejection often presenting with\ncough, low-grade fever, dyspnea, infiltrates on radiographs, and declining lung function. In\ncontrast, chronic rejection typically presents with advancing obstruction on pulmonary function\ntesting, \nno \ninfiltrates, \nand \nworsening \ndyspnea \non \nexertion. \nThis \nconstellation \nin\nposttransplantation patients is termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Fifty percent of lung\ntransplant patients have some degree of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and it is the main\nimpediment to better long-term survival. Therapy often involves augmented immunosuppression,\nalthough there is no consensus of how to do this or the duration of this augmentation.\nVI-60.   The answer is B. (Chap. 320e) Chronic kidney disease is a common finding in patients after\nlung transplantation and is associated with poorer outcomes. Although rarely patients may have\nhemolytic-uremic syndrome underlying the kidney disease, it is usually acute, and the most\ncommon etiology of gradually progressive decline in renal function is calcineurin inhibitor\nneuropathy. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibitors commonly used in\nimmunosuppressive regimens after lung transplantation. The exact mechanism of this toxicity is\nunclear but may include a direct toxicity of inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT system within the\nkidney, alteration in glomerular blood flow, and host-environment interactions within the kidney\nwith calcineurin inhibitors. Prednisone, albuterol, and mycophenolate mofetil are not known to\nbe nephrotoxic.\nVI-61.   The answer is A. (Chap. 321) Several different severity of illness (SOI) scores have been\ndeveloped for use in critically ill populations. Two of the most common systems are the Acute\nPhysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score and the Simplified Acute\nPhysiology (SAPS II) score. SOI scores are primarily useful as tools to assess populations of\ncritically ill individuals, but the scores do not perform well at predicting individual patient\noutcomes. These scores are used primarily in clinical trials to compare SOI between groups of\npatients enrolled in trials. These scores are also used by hospital administrations to assess quality\nof intensive care unit (ICU) care over time and also to help determine appropriate nursing and\nancillary support staffing levels. No SOI score should be used to direct an individual patient’s\ncare, although decision support tools based on SOI scores are being investigated. The APACHE II\nscore is the most commonly used SOI score. This score assigns values based on a variety of\ndemographic, medical history, and clinical values taking the worst value in the first 24 hours\nafter admission. Population mortality ranges based on published values range from <5%–10%\nfor scores between 0 and 4 and as high as 80%–90% for scores ≥35 points. Updated versions of\nthe APACHE score (APACHE III and IV) have been published. The SAPS II score is more\nfrequently used in Europe. This score is not disease specific, although it does add higher values\nfor AIDS, metastatic cancer, or hematologic malignancy. Both scores are used in a similar\nmanner.\nVI-62.   The answer is C. (Chap. 321) Oxygen delivery (QO2) is a function of both cardiac output (CO)\nand the oxygen content of the blood (CaO2) and can be expressed by the following equation:\nQO2 = CO × [1.39 × hemoglobin × SaO2 + (0.003 × PaO2)]\nFrom this equation, the effect of PaO2 on overall oxygen delivery is negligible. Nearly all oxygen\ndelivered to the tissues is bound to hemoglobin. One can improve oxygen delivery by increasing\ncardiac output, increasing hemoglobin, or improving oxygen saturation.\nVI-63.   The answer is C. (Chap. 321) In patients admitted to the ICU, one of the most important\naspects of care is to prevent complications that may occur during the process of care. One of the\nmost common complications is nosocomial infections, including hospital- or ventilator-acquired\npneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and Clostridium\ndifficile infection. It is important to remove indwelling devices such as central lines, urinary\ncatheters, and endotracheal tubes as soon as clinically possible. Another important preventative\nmeasure to decrease nosocomial infections includes ensuring appropriate sterile procedures for\ndevice insertion. Using care bundles and emphasizing good hand washing protocols are\nimportant strategies for decreasing nosocomial infections. Individuals in the ICU are also at\nincreased risk of deep venous thrombosis due to immobility and often have factors that increase\nhypercoagulability. Standard interventions to prevent deep venous thrombosis include use of\nlow-molecular-weight heparin or low-dose heparin along with sequential compression devices.\nProtection against development of stress ulcers is accomplished with histamine-2 blockers or\nproton pump inhibitors. The patients who benefit most from stress ulcer prophylaxis are those\nwith coagulopathy, shock, or respiratory failure. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral\nnutrition, although no definitive data demonstrate that early use of enteral nutrition provides\nbenefit. ICU-acquired weakness is also a common complication of ICU care. The mechanisms are\npoorly understood. Interventions that may improve functional outcomes in critical illness include\nearly physical and occupational therapy. Use of tight glucose control with intensive insulin\ntherapy was thought to improve ICU outcomes, but further study has demonstrated no benefits\non nosocomial infection and increased hypoglycemia with this mode of therapy.\nVI-64 and VI-65.    The answers are E and A, respectively. (Chap. 322) This patient has evidence of\nsevere ARDS. The annual incidence of ARDS is 60 cases per 100,000 population. In individuals\nadmitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, approximately 20% of these will meet the criteria\nfor ARDS, although it is generally underrecognized in the ICU population. ARDS is a clinical\nsyndrome of severe dyspnea of rapid onset, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates that\nmay lead to respiratory failure. There are myriad causes of ARDS, including sepsis, pneumonia,\naspiration pneumonitis, trauma, acute pancreatitis, multiple transfusions, and toxic inhalation\ninjury among others. The most common causes of ARDS are sepsis and pneumonia, which cause\nabout 40%–50% of all cases of ARDS. Clinically, ARDS is diagnosed in the presence of acute\nbilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia without evidence of increased left atrial filling\npressure. A consensus panel has recently revised the definition of ARDS into three categories of\nmild, moderate, and severe based on degree of hypoxemia as determined by the ratio of PaO2 to\nFiO2, commonly called P:F ratio. Mild ARDS is present if PaO2/FiO2 is ≤300 mmHg, but >200\nmm Hg. Moderate ARDS is diagnosed when PaO2/FiO2 is ≤200 mmHg and >100 mmHg.\nSevere ARDS is diagnosed when PaO2/FiO2 is ≤100 mmHg. In this case, the ratio of PaO2 to\nFiO2 is 80 mmHg, placing the patient in the category of severe ARDS. The natural history of\nARDS is three stages: exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic. In the early exudative stage of ARDS,\nthere is an acute injury to alveolar capillary endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. This\nresults in loss of the normal alveolar barrier with subsequent leakage of protein-rich fluid into\nthe alveoli (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema). In the early phase, the inflammatory cell\ninfiltrate is predominantly neutrophils. Pathologically, the finding is described as diffuse alveolar\ndamage. Hyaline membranes and loss of type I pneumocytes are seen. The exudative phase of\nARDS lasts for approximately the first 7 days of illness. The second phase of ARDS is the\nproliferative phase, which begins around day 7 and continues through day 21. Most patients\nrecover during this phase and are able to be liberated from mechanical ventilation.\nHistologically, early signs of repair can be seen in this phase with shift to a lymphocyte-\npredominant infiltrate, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and organization of the alveolar\npredominant infiltrate, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and organization of the alveolar\nedema. Only a few individuals who develop ARDS fail to recover during the proliferative phase\nand continue into the fibrotic stage of the disease. Pathologically, individuals who develop\nfibrotic ARDS demonstrate extensive alveolar and interstitial fibrosis at sites of prior alveolar\nedema. The acinar architecture frequently becomes distorted, leading to development of\nemphysematous changes with large bullae. Fibrotic proliferation may also occur in the intima of\npulmonary vasculature, leading to development of pulmonary hypertension. Given the timing of\nthe presentation, this patient would be expected to be in the exudative phase of ARDS and\nexhibit diffuse alveolar damage, loss of type I pneumocytes, and hyaline membranes.\nVI-66.   The answer is B. (Chap. 322) This individual has severe ARDS due to trauma, a pulmonary\ncontusion, and possible transfusion-related lung injury. Mechanical ventilation is frequently\nnecessary for individuals suffering from ARDS and has been essential for prolonging life and\nimproving mortality from this disorder. However, appropriate ventilator management is\nnecessary to prevent further morbidity from ventilator-associated lung injury. ARDS is not\nexperienced uniformly across the lung tissue. The dependent portions of the lungs are typically\nthe most affected, while other areas of the lung may be spared. The portions of the lung that are\nmost affected are poorly compliant and are prone to alveolar collapse. Alternatively, the more\nnormal portions of the lungs have better lung compliance. With positive-pressure ventilation,\nventilator-associated lung injury may occur as a result of overdistention of the more normal\nareas of the lung with resultant perpetuation of alveolar damage and capillary leak in these\nareas. In the poorly compliant areas, respirations initiated by the ventilator can lead to repetitive\nopening and closure of alveoli, causing further damage in these areas. Because of this, a strategy\nthat employs low tidal volumes to prevent alveolar overdistention and recurrent alveolar\ncollapse is recommended. The ARDS Network conducted a clinical trial that compared low tidal\nvolume ventilation to conventional ventilation and demonstrated improved mortality with the\nlow tidal volume strategy (31% vs. 40%). The recommended initial tidal volume setting is 6\nmL/kg of ideal body weight. This strategy is recommended in all patients with ARDS, and the\nimprovement in outcomes is not affected by obesity.\nVI-67.   The answer is D. (Chap. 322) Hypoxemia in ARDS results in shunt physiology with the\npresence of alveolar and interstitial fluid and loss of surfactant. In turn, there is significant loss\nof lung compliance and development of alveolar collapse that is worse in the dependent portions\nof the lungs. During mechanical ventilation, the goal is to minimize overdistention of less\naffected areas of the lungs while maximizing alveolar recruitment. Positive end-expiratory\npressure (PEEP) is used to prevent alveolar collapse at end-expiration. Trials of mechanical\nventilation with high-PEEP compared to low-PEEP strategies did not show any differences in\noutcomes when a low tidal volume ventilation strategy was used. More recently, a trial used a\nstrategy that involved constructing static pressure-volume curves of the lung on the mechanical\nventilator. With this strategy, a lower inflection point can be calculated. This point identifies the\npressure at which the alveoli open. In ARDS, this point is typically 12–15 cmH2O. In theory,\nsetting the PEEP to this pressure will maximize oxygenation and prevent lung injury. Trials of\nthis mode of ventilation improve lung function and may have an effect on mortality. More\nrecently, strategies employing esophageal pressure catheters to estimate optimal transpulmonary\npressure are being studied to determine the effects on oxygenation, duration of mechanical\nventilation, and mortality.\nVI-68.   The answer is B. (Chap. 322 and N Engl J Med 2006;354:2564–2575) Optimal fluid\nmanagement in ARDS is felt to be important to minimize extravasation of fluid into the\ninterstitium and alveolar spaces. However, in individuals with septic shock or other causes of\nhypotension, expansion of fluid volume to optimal levels is important in the management of\nhypotension. Whether an aggressive or conservative fluid management strategy was most\nimportant in acute lung injury was not known as there were concerns that a conservative fluid\nmanagement strategy would increase the likelihood of end-organ failure, especially acute kidney\ninjury. A trial sponsored by the ARDS Network attempted to answer this question by\nrandomizing individuals with acute lung injury to a conservative versus liberal fluid\nmanagement strategy. This trial demonstrated that a conservative fluid management strategy to\nmanagement strategy. This trial demonstrated that a conservative fluid management strategy to\nmaintain low left atrial pressure improved pulmonary mechanics and oxygenation while\ndecreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and mortality. At the same time,\nthere was no increased incidence of acute kidney injury.\nVI-69.   The answer is C. (Chap. 323) Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to respiratory support that is\nprovided through a tight-fitting face mask or nasal mask. NIV can be administered with bilevel\npositive expiratory pressure ventilation or pressure support ventilation. Both modes of\nventilation provide a higher positive pressure with inspiration and decrease to a lower pressure\nwith expiration to decrease work of breathing and provide assisted ventilation. The major\ndifficulty with using NIV clinically is poor patient tolerance due to the use of a tight-fitting mask\nand psychological discomfort and anxiety. The primary group of individuals who have benefited\nfrom the use of NIV are those with acute exacerbations of COPD. In those with COPD, several\nrandomized trials have shown low failure rates in individuals with pH of 7.25 to 7.35, along\nwith decreased need for invasive ventilation, decreased length of ICU stay, and decreased\nmortality in some studies. In those with pH >7.35, NIV confers no benefit over standard\ntherapy. In those with pH <7.25, use of NIV has a higher failure rate that is inversely\nproportional to the degree of acidosis. Another group of individuals who may benefit from NIV\nare those with decompensated systolic heart failure with respiratory acidosis. In these\nindividuals, a large clinical trial demonstrated a decreased need for invasive mechanical\nventilation. NIV in these individuals decreased both preload and afterload and can provide\nassistance to the failing heart (Gray A, et al: N Engl J Med 2008;359(2):142–151). A last group\nfor which NIV has shown promise is in individuals immediately after extubation, especially\nindividuals with COPD or hypercapnic respiratory failure. NIV is associated with higher failure\nrates in individuals with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. Invasive mechanical\nventilation is the ventilatory method of choice in these individuals, although not strictly\ncontraindicated. Contraindications to mechanical ventilation include absence of spontaneous\nrespirations, cardiac or respiratory arrest, severe encephalopathy, severe gastrointestinal bleed,\nhemodynamic instability, unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction, facial surgery or\ntrauma, upper airway obstruction, inability to protect airway, and inability to clear secretions.\nVI-70, VI-71, VI-72, and VI-73.   The answers are C, B, A, and D, respectively. (Chap. 323)\nMechanical ventilation can be delivered in many different modes, which refers to the manner in\nwhich the breaths are triggered, cycled, and delivered. The most common mode of mechanical\nventilation is assist-control. This mode is volume cycled and flow limited. An inspiratory cycle\nmay be triggered by patient effort or, if there is no patient effort within a specific time, by a\ntimer within the ventilator. Each breath, whether triggered by patient effort or the ventilator,\ndelivers an operator-specified tidal volume. This mode is frequently the initial mode of\nmechanical ventilation when a patient is intubated as it ensures a known minute ventilation in\nthe absence of respiratory effort. Common difficulties with the use of assist-control ventilation\nare asynchrony with the ventilator and tachypnea, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis and/or\ngeneration of dynamic hyperinflation. This occurs when a patient triggers an inspiratory cycle\nbefore a full exhalation occurs. Commonly known as auto-PEEP, dynamic hyperinflation can lead\nto decreased venous return and a fall in cardiac output. It may also lead to barotrauma,\nincluding pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) is\na mixed mode of ventilation. IMV is primarily a volume-cycled and flow-limited mode of\nventilation and is most often delivered in a synchronized mode (SIMV). The ventilator will\ndeliver a mandatory number of breaths at a specified tidal volume. If a patient breathes only at\nthe set respiratory rate, SIMV is essentially the same as assist-control ventilation. When a patient\nbreathes above the set respiratory rate, the spontaneous breaths may be unassisted or assisted\nwith a pressure support mode of ventilation. SIMV was commonly used as a weaning mode of\nventilation, but clinical trials have shown that trials of spontaneous breathing lead to a shorter\nduration of mechanical ventilation and more rapid extubation. Pressure control ventilation (PCV)\nis time triggered, time cycled, and pressure limited. This mode is often used in individuals who\nhave preexisting barotrauma or for postoperative thoracic surgery patients. It is also used in\nARDS to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. In PCV, there is no prespecified minimum tidal\nARDS to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. In PCV, there is no prespecified minimum tidal\nvolume or minute ventilation. Rather, a specified pressure is set during inspiration by the\noperator, and the tidal volume and inspiratory flow rate are dependent upon lung compliance.\nPressure support ventilation (PSV) is patient triggered, flow cycled, and pressure limited. PSV\nrequires a patient to spontaneously initiate respiration because no machine-delivered breaths are\ngiven. PSV provides graded assistance through application of an inspiratory pressure that\naugments spontaneous respiration. The pressure support falls to a specified expiratory pressure\nwhen the flow falls below a certain rate. PSV is often combined with SIMV to augment the\nspontaneously generated breaths. PSV also is used in ventilator weaning as it is generally well\ntolerated.\nVI-74.   The answer is C. (Chap. 323) Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) have been determined to be\nthe best way to assess whether a patient has recovered sufficiently from respiratory failure to be\nextubated. An SBT can be implemented via T-piece, CPAP at low levels of pressure (1–5 cmH2O),\nor pressure support ventilation applied to offset the resistance of the endotracheal tube. A\npatient will undergo an SBT from 30 minutes to 2 hours to determine if respiration can be\nmaintained to support liberation from mechanical ventilation. It is important to recognize which\npatients are appropriate to undergo SBT. The following conditions predict patients who are\nready for weaning attempts: (1) lung injury is stable or resolving; (2) gas exchange is adequate,\nwith PEEP generally <8 cmH2O and FiO2 <0.5; (3) hemodynamic parameters are stable\nwithout need for ongoing vasopressor support; and (4) the patient has spontaneous respiratory\nactivity.\nVI-75.   The answer is A. (Chap. 324) Shock is a complex pathophysiologic process that occurs in\nresponse to a decline in tissue perfusion. Clinically, shock states manifest with a mean arterial\npressure <60 mmHg. This nonspecific term can be caused by many different etiologies including\nsepsis, hypovolemia, trauma, hypoadrenal states, neurologic causes, and cardiac causes. Shock\nstates result in a decrease in tissue oxygen delivery. In turn, this creates a multifaceted response\nthat can become a self-perpetuating process that leads to further tissue injury. Hypotension\ndisinhibits the vasomotor center, leading to increased adrenergic output and decreased vagal\ntone. Norepinephrine leads to significant splanchnic and peripheral vasoconstriction in an\nattempt to maintain cerebral and cardiac blood flow. Other constrictor substances are secreted as\nwell including angiotensin II, vasopressin, endothelin-1, and thromboxane A2. In addition, there\nis pressure to maintain intravascular fluid volume through alterations in hydrostatic pressure and\nosmolarity. However, constriction of arterioles leads to reduction in capillary hydrostatic\npressure and the number of capillary beds perfused. This limits the capillary surface area\navailable for perfusion with the resultant increase in vascular oncotic pressure. This in turn leads\nto a net reabsorption of fluid into the vascular bed. Metabolic changes including glycolysis,\nlipolysis, and proteolysis further increase interstitial and intravascular volume at the expense of\nintracellular volume due to their effects on raising extracellular osmolarity. Within the cells,\nthere is rapid depletion of high-energy phosphate stores. This leads to mitochondrial dysfunction\nwith uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation with accumulation of reactive oxygen species,\nlactate, and hydrogen ions. The byproducts of anaerobic metabolism can overcome the\ncompensatory vasoconstrictor mechanisms and lead to further hypotension. Extensive\nproinflammatory pathways are activated in shock and contribute to the development of multiple\norgan dysfunction and failure. After the initial insult, a counterregulatory process should be\ninitiated to balance the proinflammatory response. In individuals who have an excessive\nproinflammatory response that cannot be effectively regulated, the inflammatory process may\ncontinue unregulated and lead to further organ injury and failure. At the system level, shock\naffects a variety of endocrine, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal processes, among others. In\naddition to increases in norepinephrine, the stress associated with shock increases\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to increase cortisol secretion. Renin is also released in\nresponse to adrenergic discharge and decreased renal perfusion. Renin induces the formation of\nangiotensin I, which is converted to the active angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor.\nAngiotensin II also stimulates release of aldosterone and vasopressin. The cardiac response to\nshock is to initially compensate by increasing heart rate. Many causes of shock, however, are\nshock is to initially compensate by increasing heart rate. Many causes of shock, however, are\nassociated with depression of myocardial contractility such that stroke volume is decreased for\nany given filling pressure. The pulmonary response may lead to development of noncardiogenic\npulmonary edema, ARDS, and decreased lung compliance. Finally, the kidney responds to shock\nby conserving salt and water.\nVI-76.   The answer is E. (Chap. 324) Different causes of shock are associated with different physiologic\nfindings throughout the vascular system. Although rarely used in most cases of shock, a\npulmonary artery catheter can be used to measure these values. However, it is important to\nunderstand pathologically what occurs in the vascular system. The typical measured variables\ninclude cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), mixed venous oxygen saturation\n(SVO2), central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).\nPatients who have interruption of sympathetic vasomotor input after high cervical cord injury or\nmajor head injury may experience neurogenic shock. In neurogenic shock, there is arteriolar\ndilation and venodilation. The result is a fall in all variables measured (CO, SVR, SVO2, CVP, and\nPCWP) (option E). Hypovolemia is the most common cause of shock and occurs due to acute\nblood loss or significant loss of plasma volume due to extravascular fluid sequestration.\nGastrointestinal or renal fluid losses may also lead to hypovolemic shock. In hypovolemic shock,\nCO is low; SVR is elevated; and SVO2, CVP, and PCWP are low (option A). Cardiogenic shock\n(option B) has similarly low CO, elevated SVR, and low SVO2. However, CVP and PCWP are\nelevated. Septic shock can be hyperdynamic or hypodynamic. Early in the septic shock, the\nhyperdynamic state predominates and is associated with increased CO, low SVR, and low SVO2.\nCVP and PCWP are variable and may be low, normal, or elevated (option C). The hypodynamic\nstate of septic shock is associated with low CO and high SVR with variable effect of CVP, PCWP,\nand SVO2. Shock following trauma is most often due to hypovolemia. However, after\nintravascular volume is restored, some individuals will continue to experience hypotension due\nto loss of plasma volume into the interstitium and injured tissues. This type of shock will be\nassociated with variable effects on CO and SVR with low SVO2, CVP, and PCWP. Finally,\nhypoadrenalism is a rare cause of shock associated with unrecognized adrenal insufficiency.\nHypoadrenal shock presents with a low CO, low SVO2, low CVP, low PCWP, and normal to low\nSVR.\nVI-77.   The answer is A. (Chap. 325) Sepsis and septic shock represent a harmful host response to\ninfection and are contributing factors to more than 200,000 deaths in the United States each\nyear. Over the past 30 years, the incidence of sepsis has risen along with our aging population.\nAnnually, there are more than 750,000 cases of sepsis yearly with an incidence of 3 per 1000\npopulation. Most cases of sepsis occur in individuals with underlying illness. The incidence also\nincreases with age and increasing comorbidities. Other risk factors for sepsis include\nimmunocompromised state and indwelling vascular or mechanical devices. The most common\nsource of infection in individuals with sepsis is the lungs, accounting for 64% of cases of sepsis.\nMicrobial invasion of the bloodstream is not required for an individual to develop the systemic\nresponse that leads to multiorgan dysfunction in sepsis. Blood cultures are only positive in 40%–\n70% of cases of septic shock and approximately 20%–40% of cases of severe sepsis. When a\nculture is positive from any site, the most common organisms are gram-negative bacteria (62%),\nwith P aeruginosa and Escherichia coli being the most common. Gram-positive bacteria are present\nin approximately 47% of cases, and 19% occurred in people infected with fungi. Because the\nnumbers add up to >100%, it should be noted that multiple bacteria may be implicated in\nsepsis.\nVI-78.   The answer is C. (Chap. 325 and JAMA 2016;315:801–810) Sepsis represents a dysregulated\nhost response to infection, and severity can range broadly from a mild inflammatory response to\nrefractory septic shock (Table VI-78). Multiple professional medical societies have attempted to\ncreate a standardized definition of sepsis and septic shock over the years to aid in early\nidentification of sepsis with the goal of improving patient outcomes. The most recent definition\nof sepsis simplifies diagnosis into two categories: sepsis and septic shock. This eliminates prior\ncategories included in the continuum of sepsis including systemic inflammatory response\ncategories included in the continuum of sepsis including systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis. SIRS criteria may be present in many individuals with\ninfection who do not develop progressive symptoms of sepsis. The symptoms that may indicate a\nharmful systemic response to infection are many of those previously included in the SIRS\ndefinition, including fever or hypothermia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. However,\nSIRS can be present due to systemic inflammatory responses with other stresses such as trauma\nor acute pancreatitis that are not caused by infection. Thus, the term SIRS is neither sensitive nor\nspecific for identifying patients at risk of developing sepsis. Severe sepsis was also a term with\nlimited specificity and did not provide additional risk stratification. In the simplified definition,\nthere is greater reliance on use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Sepsis\nis thus defined as a suspected or documented infection with an acute increase of ≥2 points,\nwhereas septic shock is clinically defined as sepsis with need for vasopressor support and\nelevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) despite adequate fluid resuscitation. The SOFA score incorporates\na variety of measures to determine the magnitude of multiorgan dysfunction. Variables include\nPaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count, bilirubin, Glasgow Coma Scale score, creatinine, urine output,\nand blood pressure/vasopressor support. Sepsis is identified as evidence of infection with\nevidence of organ dysfunction. Using the SOFA score as a determinant of organ dysfunction\ncreates a more standard measure for identifying sepsis. A patient may be considered in refractory\nseptic shock if the mean arterial pressure remains low for >1 hour despite fluid resuscitation\nand vasopressors. Refractory septic shock is not included in the guidelines.\nTALBLE VI-78   Definitions Used to Describe the Condition of Septic Patients\nVI-79.   The answer is B. (Chap. 325) Blood cultures are positive in only 40%–70% of cases of sepsis,\nalthough in most individuals, a source of infection can be identified through examination of\ninfected material (e.g., sputum, abscess fluid, urine) or through the identification of RNA or DNA\nin blood or tissue samples. In some individuals, the immediate source of infection is not\napparent. In cases of sepsis and septic shock, it is important to initiate antibiotic therapy\nimmediately while awaiting culture data to become available. A delay in antibiotic therapy as\nlittle as 1 hour has been associated with lower survival rates. In addition, use of “inappropriate”\nantibiotics defined on the basis of local susceptibility patterns and published guidelines for\nempiric antibiotic therapy is associated with a fivefold increase in mortality. This patient has\nevidence of septic shock and has had a prior splenectomy. Patients who have had splenectomy\nare at risk for sepsis due to encapsulated organisms. In these individuals, sepsis is most\ncommonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria\nmeningitidis may also be implicated. In an asplenic patient with sepsis, the patient should be\nempirically treated with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. In areas where there is significant resistance\nof S pneumoniae to cephalosporins, vancomycin should be added. In most areas, the\ncephalosporin resistance is only 1%. If a patient is allergic to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones\nshould be used as an alternative medication.\nVI-80.   The answer is B. (Chap. 325) Mortality in sepsis remains high, with approximately 20%–35%\nof individuals dying when severe sepsis is present and up to 60% dying due to septic shock.\nMortality increases with increasing age and number of comorbidities. Numerous interventions\nhave been attempted to try to decrease mortality by providing better supportive care or targeting\nthe underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to organ failure in sepsis. An example of a\nsupportive measure that has been proven ineffective in sepsis is insulin therapy to achieve tight\nglucose control. The rationale for lower blood glucose in sepsis was that hyperglycemia was\nassociated with poorer outcomes in critical illness. After initial enthusiasm from data generated\nby a single-center trial in a surgical ICU, the benefits were not demonstrated in a medically ill\npopulation. Meta-analyses have concluded that intensive insulin therapy does not affect survival\nand may lead to harm, particularly from hypoglycemia. Anemia also frequently develops in\nindividuals with critical illness. The target hemoglobin necessary to maintain oxygen-carrying\ncapacity has to be balanced against potential harm from transfusion therapy, including infection\nand transfusion-associated acute lung injury. A randomized trial demonstrated that patients were\nnot harmed by a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion (7 g/dL) compared to a higher\nhemoglobin goal (9 g/dL). Patients with refractory hypotension in sepsis have been shown to\nhave a relative deficiency of cortisol in the face of profound metabolic stress. This so-called\ncritical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency may lead to worse outcomes in critical illness.\nTrials to determine which patients would most benefit from corticosteroid replacement used\nadrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation to assess adrenal response to stimulus. However, this\napproach did not lead to improved outcomes, and most practitioners favor a more empiric\napproach to corticosteroid replacement. Hydrocortisone should be considered at a dose of 50 mg\nevery 6 hours in patients with septic shock on vasopressors. If clinical improvement occurs with\nuse of hydrocortisone over 24–48 hours, then a course of therapy for 5–7 days is indicated. Other\ninterventions that have been trialed but failed for septic shock include endotoxin-neutralizing\nproteins, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or nitric oxide synthase, anticoagulants, polyclonal\nantibodies, and inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, platelet-activating factor, and\ntissue factor pathway. One of the most widely known medications used for sepsis was\nrecombinant activated protein C (APC). This medication was approved by the FDA for severe\nsepsis and septic shock based on the outcome of a randomized controlled trial that showed a\nmortality benefit in patients who were more severely ill. Subsequent trials showed no benefit in\npatients with less severe illness and in children. A subsequent confirmatory trial showed no\nbenefit to APC, and it was removed from the market 10 years after being approved.\nVI-81.   The answer is D. (Chap. 326) The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V3-V6.\nThis patient is presenting in cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute anterior myocardial\ninfarction (MI), likely due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\ninfarction (MI), likely due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\nCardiogenic shock is characterized by systemic hypoperfusion due to depression of the cardiac\nindex and sustained arterial hypotension despite an elevated filling pressure. The incidence of\ncardiogenic shock was as high as 20% in the 1960s. Over time, this has decreased to about 5%–\n7% in the setting of early reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI). The cause of\ncardiogenic shock in acute MI is primarily due to left ventricular pump failure in approximately\n80% of cases but can be associated with acute mitral regurgitation in the setting of papillary\nmuscle dysfunction, ventricular septal rupture, right ventricular failure in inferior MI, or free\nwall rupture. Only 25% of patients who develop cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute MI will\npresent already in shock. Another 25% will develop it within the first 6 hours after presentation.\nThe other 50% of individuals who develop cardiogenic shock in acute MI will develop it after\nthis time point. Rapid recognition and treatment of the underlying myocardial ischemia are the\nmost important tools in the management of patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock.\nSupportive measures include providing adequate volume to maintain left ventricular filling\npressure and treatment of pain while avoiding medications that have negative inotropic effects.\nMechanical ventilation is commonly required to prevent hypoxemia. Augmentation of blood\npressure to maintain cardiac perfusion is often required. No vasopressor agent has been shown to\nchange the outcome of patients in established cardiogenic shock. Norepinephrine is a potent\nvasoconstrictor and inotropic agent. In a trial comparing norepinephrine with dopamine,\nnorepinephrine was associated with fewer adverse events, including arrhythmias. Given the\nrelative safety compared to dopamine, norepinephrine is the preferred initial agent for blood\npressure support. Dopamine should be a second-line agent in this patient given the presence of\nventricular ectopy and tachycardia because dopamine is associated with the development of\ntachyarrhythmias. Vasopressin is a potent vasoconstrictor and may be considered in only low\ndoses in the treatment of shock. Doses greater than 0.03 U/min have been associated with\ncoronary and mesenteric ischemia. Nitroglycerin as a continuous drip may be considered for\nvenodilation and management of the patient’s pain. However, it would be expected to decrease\nblood pressure and should not be used in the absence of other means of circulatory support. Of\nthe options listed, the best choice for circulatory support in this patient is the placement of an\nintra-aortic balloon pump. This temporary percutaneous device is inserted into the aorta via the\nfemoral artery, and the balloon is expanded during ventricular diastole to maintain coronary\nartery perfusion pressure. During systole, the rapid deflation of the blood provides effective\nafterload reduction to support a failing heart. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation is rarely used for acute MI but may be considered when respiratory failure\ncomplicates cardiogenic shock.\nVI-82.   The answer is A. (Chap. 326) The patient has evidence of decompensated ischemic\ncardiomyopathy with marked volume overload, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. Initial\nmanagement of this patient includes maintenance of adequate oxygenation and circulatory\nsupport while initiating diuresis. Figure VI-82 outlines the optimal treatment for acute\npulmonary edema. Oxygenation should be maintained, and intubation with mechanical\nventilation is frequently required. The combination of nitroglycerin and morphine provides\nvenodilation and decreases venous return and, in turn, decreases the work of breathing.\nMorphine further provides symptomatic relief of dyspnea and anxiety. Furosemide or other loop\ndiuretics should be administered at the equivalent furosemide dose of 0.5–1.0 mg/kg.\nNorepinephrine may be required when the systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mmHg to\nmaintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. Dobutamine is a positive inotropic agent that is\noften used for cardiogenic shock but may acutely cause a decline in blood pressure. It should be\nconsidered when the systolic blood pressure is 70–100 mmHg without signs and symptoms of\nshock.\nFIGURE VI-82 ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; BP, blood pressure; IV, intravenous; SBP,\nsystolic blood pressure; SL, sublingual.

(Chap. 326) Table VI-83 outlines the hemodynamic patterns that can be seen\nin various forms of shock, including shock caused by a variety of complications of acute MI. This\npatient presents with acute hypotension following a coronary revascularization procedure for\nacute anterior MI. Acute severe mitral regurgitation can occur following acute MI due to\npapillary muscle dysfunction and rupture, resulting in cardiogenic shock and/or pulmonary\nedema. This complication most often occurs within the first day after an MI, although there is a\nsecond peak of occurrence several days after MI. Other complications that can occur after MI\nresulting in rapid development of hypotension and cardiogenic shock include ventricular septal\nrupture, cardiac tamponade, and free wall rupture. It is important to understand the\nhemodynamics of these complications as well as other causes of shock, although clinically,\npulmonary artery catheters are used less frequently these days because their use has not been\npulmonary artery catheters are used less frequently these days because their use has not been\nassociated with improvements in care. Normal values (option B) are shown in the top most\nportion of the table and are important for general knowledge regarding the circulatory system. A\npatient with acute mitral regurgitation (option C) would have normal to elevated right atrial\npressure and elevations in the right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary artery pressures,\nalthough right ventricular diastolic pressure may be normal or elevated. The most characteristic\nfinding is an elevation in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with a prominent v\nwave. The large v wave represents the pressure generated during systole across the regurgitant\nmitral valve. Cardiac index would be low normal to low, with normal to elevated systemic\nvascular resistance. Individuals with cardiac tamponade demonstrate equalization of pressures\nacross the vascular system with a low cardiac index (option E). This is manifest as right atrial\npressure, right ventricular diastolic pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and PCWP all\nmanifesting similar values. Free wall rupture causes cardiac tamponade and has a dramatic\npresentation, often leading to death. It can present more subacutely if the pericardium is able to\ntemporarily seal the rupture site. Ventricular septal rupture presents similarly to acute mitral\nregurgitation. However, the hemodynamics are different as the right atrial pressure and right\nventricular diastolic pressure are typically higher, whereas PCWP may not be as elevated.\nCardiogenic shock with right ventricular failure that can occur following inferior MI or\npulmonary embolus will demonstrate a low cardiac index and elevated right atrial and right\nventricular diastolic pressures with a wedge pressure that may be low, normal, or elevated\n(option D). The patient presenting with elevated cardiac output and low right atrial and\nventricular pressures as well as low PCWP is most typical of a patient with septic shock.\nTALBLE VI-83   Hemodynamic Patternsa\nVI-84.   The answer is B. (Chap. 327) Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is responsible for between 200,000\nand 450,000 deaths yearly in the United States. SCD is defined as natural death due to cardiac\nand 450,000 deaths yearly in the United States. SCD is defined as natural death due to cardiac\ncauses with presentation within 1 hour or less from a change heralding the onset of the terminal\nclinical event and the onset of cardiac arrest. In an individual who experiences an unwitnessed\ndeath, pathologists may expand the definition to up to 24 hours after the individual was last seen\nto be alive and stable. If an individual is successfully resuscitated from SCD, he or she would still\nbe classified as SCD if death occurs during the initial hospitalization or within 30 days of the\nresuscitated cardiac event. In two-thirds of individuals, SCD is the first clinical expression of\nunderlying cardiac disease, and up to half of all cardiac deaths are sudden and unexpected. SCD\ncan occur due to primary arrhythmia, arrhythmia induced following an acute cardiac event, a\nstructural abnormality following a prior cardiac event, or acute low-output states that may occur\ndue to acute pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, anaphylaxis, and cardiac\ntamponade, among other causes. There is a peak in sudden, unexpected deaths between birth\nand 6 months of age (sudden infant death syndrome), with a second peak that occurs between\nthe ages of 45 and 75 years with an incidence of 1–2 per 1000 per year. Individuals of African\nAmerican descent have a higher incidence of SCD compared to the white population. Young and\nmiddle-aged men have a higher risk of SCD compared to women, but with advancing age, the\ngender differences in SCD disappear. Genetic factors also play a role in the risk for SCD because\nhaving a parental history of SCD as an initial presentation of cardiac disease increases the\nlikelihood of a similar event in offspring. Other risk factors include those of cardiac disease,\nincluding smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. In the past, ventricular\nfibrillation and ventricular tachycardia were the most common arrhythmias seen in patients\nexperiencing SCD. However, asystole currently accounts for about 50% of all cases of SCD.\nPrognosis and outcome depend on the underlying etiology of the event. Ventricular tachycardia\nand ventricular fibrillation have significantly better outcomes when compared to individuals\nwho present with asystole or pulseless electrical activity.\nVI-85.   The answer is D. (Chap. 328) Coma is a surprisingly common medical condition that is\nresponsible for a large number of admissions to emergency and critical care units. Coma refers to\na deep sleeplike state from which a patient cannot be aroused. It occurs on a continuum of\ndisorders of decreased alertness that includes stupor, in which a patient can be transiently\naroused with vigorous stimulation and with generally purposeful response to painful stimuli.\nDrowsiness is a light state of decreased alertness that is similar to light sleep. A patient can be\naroused easily, and alertness typically persists for a period after arousal. There are multiple\netiologies of coma and several disorders that can cause unresponsiveness that can be confused\nwith coma. Some of the common causes of coma include drug intoxications, metabolic\nderangements, severe systemic infections, shock, seizures, hypertensive encephalopathy,\nconcussion, meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and intracranial mass lesions,\namong others. One condition that is often confused with coma is the persistent vegetative state.\nA vegetative state refers to someone who has emerged from coma with an awake appearance but\nis unresponsive. There are few, if any, meaningful responses to stimuli from the environment.\nPersistent vegetative state occurs following significant damage to both cerebral hemispheres with\npreservation of brainstem function. It occurs most commonly following cardiac arrest or\ntraumatic brain injury. A minimally conscious state is similar to the persistent vegetative state\nbut less severe. The patient appears awake, can make rudimentary vocalizations, and may have\nsome purposeful motor behaviors, occasionally in response to commands. Other syndromes that\ncan mimic coma include akinetic mutism, catatonia, and locked-in state. Akinetic mutism occurs\ndue to extreme hydrocephalus or damage to the medial thalamic nuclei or frontal lobes. In\nakinetic mutism, the patient appears awake and is able to think and form memories but is unable\nto move or speak. Upon recovery, the patient can recount events from the period of the mutism.\nCatatonia usually occurs in individuals with severe psychiatric illness. Patients make few\nvoluntary or responsive movements, although they do not appear distressed. On careful\nexamination, it usually becomes apparent the patient is responsive. Eyes will move with head\nrotation, and the patient will blink with a visual threat. Other subtle signs may be present as\nwell. Locked-in syndrome occurs following an injury to the ventral pons. In this setting, the\npatient has normal cerebral function but has no means to produce speech or movement. The only\nmovements a patient will have are voluntary vertical movement of the eyes and lid elevation.\nVI-86.   The answer is B. (Chap. 328) Figure VI-86 shows a large left-sided subdural hematoma with\ncompression of the upper midbrain and lower thalamic regions. The regions are displaced away\nfrom the mass, and there is transtentorial uncal herniation of the medial temporal lobe. Cerebral\nherniation occurs when brain is displaced by an adjacent mass into a contiguous compartment\nthat it does not occupy. There are several types of brain herniation: uncal, central, transfalcical,\nand foraminal. The most common type is uncal herniation, which occurs when brain is displaced\nacross the tentorium from the supratentorial to infratentorial compartment. The uncus (anterior\nmedial temporal gyrus) moves into the tentorial opening just anterior and adjacent to the\nmidbrain. This causes compression of the ipsilateral third nerve with subsequent enlargement of\nthe ipsilateral pupil. Coma is caused by compression of the midbrain against the opposite\ntentorial edge. Lateral displacement of the midbrain may also cause compression of the opposite\ncerebral peduncle causing a contralateral hemiparesis and Babinski sign. Central transtentorial\nherniation causes a symmetric displacement of the thalamic structures through the tentorial\nopening, compressing the midbrain. Miotic pupils and decreased alertness occur as opposed to\nenlargement of a single pupil with uncal herniation. As both central and uncal herniation\nprogress, there is a similar progression of clinical signs with progressive dysfunction of the\nmidbrain, pons, and finally, the medulla. Transfalcical herniation occurs when cingulate gyrus is\ndisplaced under the falx and across the midline. Foraminal herniation occurs when the cerebellar\ntonsils are forced into the foramen magnum and results in rapid death due to compression of the\nrespiratory center.\nVI-87.   The answer is C. (Chap. 328) The coma in this patient is caused by drug intoxication, most\nlikely tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Coma is commonly caused by drug intoxications and\ncompounded by the resulting metabolic derangements. Because the patient is unresponsive, it is\nnot possible to obtain a medical history, but family members and friends should be queried to\nassist with determining a possible cause. This patient has had recent depression, which could\npotentially indicate use of antidepressant medications and also increased suicide risk. Tricyclic\nantidepressants exert an anticholinergic effect. Common symptoms include an alerted level of\nconsciousness, cardiac conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, and evidence of anticholinergic\nactivity including elevated temperature, flushing, and dilated pupils. If cardiac conduction delays\nare present, sodium bicarbonate should be given. Other supportive care includes use of\nintravenous fluids and management of agitation.\nVI-88.   The answer is E. (Chap. 328) Brain death refers to the irreversible loss of all cerebral and\nbrainstem function. Cardiac activity is preserved, and respiration is maintained only by artificial\nmeans. In Western society, brain death is considered equivalent to death, and the respirator can\nbe disconnected to allow cardiac death to occur. Careful examination of a patient needs to be\nperformed to assess when brain death has occurred. At the time of examination, the patient\nneeds to be normothermic and have been without treatment with sedative medications for at\nleast 6–24 hours. Patients should also be maintaining a systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg and\nbe euvolemic. Ideal criteria are simple, can be assessed at the bedside, and should have no\nchance of diagnostic error. Three essential elements of brain death include:\n1. Widespread cortical destruction identified by coma and unresponsiveness to all stimuli.\n2. Global brainstem damage evidenced by absent pupillary light reflexes and loss of\noculovestibular and corneal reflexes\n3. Loss of medullary function with complete and irreversible apnea\nThe pupils are usually mid-sized, but can be enlarged. However, they should not be miotic. Deep\ntendon reflexes may be present, and Babinski response is usually absent or flexor. The apnea test\nis performed by preoxygenating a patient with 100% FiO2 for up to 10 minutes, with oxygen\ndelivered via transtracheal cannula throughout the test. The patient remains off the ventilator for\n8–10 minutes, and signs of respiration are observed. At the end of the test, an arterial blood gas is\nperformed to demonstrate that PaCO2 has risen to 50–60 mmHg. Apnea is confirmed if there is\nno evidence of respiration when the PaCO2 has risen to a level that should have stimulated\nrespiration. The apnea test should be terminated if the patient develops cardiovascular instability.\nrespiration. The apnea test should be terminated if the patient develops cardiovascular instability.\nOther ancillary tests are sometimes performed in patients who cannot undergo clinical testing of\nbrain death. Examples of scenarios in which ancillary tests may be useful include patients who\nare hemodynamically unstable, patients with diseases causing baseline carbon dioxide retention,\nand in the presence of prior sedation or neuromuscular blocking agents. The purpose of ancillary\ntesting is to demonstrate lack of cerebral blood flow, and ancillary testing can include\nradionuclide brain imaging, cerebral angiography, and/or transcranial Doppler measurements.\nVI-89.   The answer is B. (Chap. 330) Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important tool in the\ncare of selected critically ill patients due to neurologic injury or disease. ICP can be monitored\nby ventriculostomy, intraparenchymal transducer, epidural catheter, or subarachnoid catheters.\nEpidural or subarachnoid catheters are less reliable and are less frequently used.\nVentriculostomy is considered the “gold standard” for ICP monitoring because it offers the\nadvantage of providing a means of cerebrospinal fluid drainage in the event of elevated ICP. In\naddition, ventriculostomy monitoring also provides greater accuracy because it has the ability to\nbe recalibrated, whereas the intraparenchymal monitor does not. Patients who are most likely to\nbe considered for ICP monitoring are those with severe primary neurologic disorders, including\nsevere traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8), large tissue shifts from supratentorial\nischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, intraventricular hemorrhage, or posterior fossa stroke.\nIndividuals with fulminant hepatic failure are also at risk for severe cerebral edema leading to\nherniation. ICP monitoring is recommended for these individuals, although intraparenchymal\nmonitoring is often more appropriate than ventriculostomy due to the presence of coagulopathy.\nThese patients are at particularly high risk of bleeding. In addition, individuals with diffuse\ncerebral edema, such as in fulminant hepatic failure, typically have small ventricles leading to\ndifficulty in placement.\nVI-90.   The answer is D. (Chap. 330) The primary goal of ICP monitoring in patients with severe\nneurologic injury and elevated ICP is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).\nCPP is calculated as mean arterial pressure minus the ICP, and the goal CPP is ≥60 mmHg.\nNormal ICP is <20 mmHg. Thus, this patient is showing evidence of marked elevations in ICP\nwith a CPP of 58 mmHg. When ICP remains elevated for more than 5 minutes, therapy should be\nundertaken to decrease the ICP. It is important to consider the underlying cause of ICP in an\nindividual when determining treatment plan. In patients with hydrocephalus or subarachnoid\nhemorrhage, draining cerebrospinal fluid via the ventriculostomy will decrease the ICP. In\npatients with more diffuse cerebral edema from head trauma or stroke, medical approaches are\nmore appropriate. This patient has hydrocephalus due to subarachnoid bleeding. Therefore, the\nfirst line of treatment should be to drain the ventriculostomy. If this fails to adequately alleviate\nthe elevations in ICP, other treatment modalities including osmolar therapy, sedation,\nhyperventilation, or vasopressors to increase mean arterial pressure can be considered. There are\ntwo osmolar therapies that are frequently used: mannitol or 23.4% saline bolus. Deep sedation\nmay be required, and a variety of agents may be used. Neuromuscular blockade may be used as\nwell. Hyperventilation to drop the PaCO2 to 30–35 mmHg works acutely to drop the ICP, but the\neffect is limited. Vasopressors can be considered to increase the mean arterial pressure and thus\nensure an improved CPP. Glucocorticoids are best used in individuals with vasogenic edema\nfrom tumor or abscess. In those with refractory elevations in ICP, decompressive craniectomy,\nhigh-dose barbiturate therapy, or hypothermia may also be employed.\nVI-91.   The answer is C. (Chap. 330) Therapeutic hypothermia refers to the purposeful induction of\nhypothermia to temperatures of 32–34°C, and it is primarily used following cardiac arrest. The\nrationale for use of therapeutic hypothermia is to provide a neuroprotective effect to limit\nneuronal cell injury and death following a substantial hypoxic insult. Initially, two trials\nsuggested that use of therapeutic hypothermia would improve functional outcomes in patients\nwho remained comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Subsequent trials showed no\nsignificant difference in neurologic outcomes if the temperature was maintained at 32°C or 36°C\nso long as development of fever was prevented. Treatment guidelines currently support\ntherapeutic hypothermia for 12–24 hours when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation.\ntherapeutic hypothermia for 12–24 hours when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation.\nWhile cerebral edema is a common complication of cardiac arrest and a leading cause of death,\nthere is no recommendation to perform head imaging prior to initiating therapeutic\nhypothermia. Complications of therapeutic hypothermia include coagulopathy and increased risk\nof infection.\nVI-92.   The answer is B. (Chap. 330) Critical illness polyneuropathy is the most common peripheral\nnervous system complication of critical illness. Prior studies have shown that as many as 70% of\nindividuals hospitalized in intensive care units with sepsis develop critical illness\npolyneuropathy. The clinical presentation of critical illness polyneuropathy is diffuse weakness\nwith decreased deep tendon reflexes and distal sensory loss. On electrophysiologic testing, a\ndiffuse, symmetric distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy is seen. The cause of critical illness\npolyneuropathy is not known but is postulated to be due to circulating inflammatory cytokines\nthat are commonly elevated is sepsis and other critical illness. Risk factors for development of\nthe syndrome include sepsis, prolonged critical illness, and multiorgan system failure. In severe\ncases, critical illness polyneuropathy can lead to decreased respiratory muscle strength and can\ncontribute to prolonged ventilator dependence. Treatment is supportive, and recovery is\nspontaneous, although it may take weeks to months for full recovery.\nCritical illness myopathy is a term used to describe several discrete muscular disorders in\ncritically ill individuals. It is less common than critical illness polyneuropathy and may have\nelevated levels of serum creatine kinase. As disease progresses, electromyography can show\nabnormal spontaneous activity. Muscle biopsy is variable, with results ranging from type II\natrophy to panfascicular necrosis. This patient does not show evidence of fibroproliferative\nprogression of acute respiratory distress syndrome as the chest radiograph shows clearing of\ninfiltrates. The patient also requires minimal ventilatory support with good tidal volumes.\nGuillain-Barré syndrome is an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy that presents as a cause of\nrespiratory failure and is not present in this case. ICU delirium is a common complication of ICU\ncare but should not result in low tidal volumes when ventilatory support is decreased.\nVI-93 and VI-94.    The answers are E and E, respectively. (Chap. 330) Nontraumatic subarachnoid\nhemorrhage (SAH) occurs most commonly following rupture of a saccular, or berry, aneurysm.\nAutopsy and angiography studies have identified aneurysms in 2% of the adult population,\naffecting 4 million individuals. The yearly incidence of SAH due to aneurysmal rupture is\n20,000–30,000 cases. Many patients die before reaching the hospital. If a patient survives to\nhospital admission, the 28-day mortality rate is 45%. More than half of individuals who survive\nhave significant neurologic injury with lingering manifestations. The patient with SAH should be\nadmitted to a critical care unit with expertise in managing SAH. Initial treatment of SAH\nincludes early aneurysmal repair while managing intracranial hypertension. Repair of the\naneurysm may be accomplished via neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling of the\naneurysm. Generally coiling has shown improved functional outcomes in those undergoing\nendovascular procedures. Medical management is complex. Intracranial hypertension is common\nand frequently requires management with ventriculostomy. Medical management of elevated\nintracranial pressures is also often required. If a patient survives the initial period following\nSAH, the patient is vulnerable to several causes of delayed neurologic deficits that typically\npresent within 1–2 weeks after the event. Vasospasm refers to the narrowing of the arteries at\nthe base of the brain following SAH and is the most common cause of delayed morbidity and\nmortality in SAH. Signs of ischemic injury and change in neurologic exam herald the\ndevelopment of vasospasm. Nimodipine is typically prescribed at a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours\nupon admission to the ICU to attempt to prevent vasospasm. Vasospasm can be detected by x-ray\nangiography or transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Surveillance for vasospasm is often performed\nvia transcranial Doppler ultrasound on a daily or every-other-day basis. In addition to\nnimodipine, management of acute vasospasm includes raising cerebral perfusion pressure and\nvolume expansion. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine are the most frequently used vasopressors.\nIf vasospasm is refractory to these treatments, intra-arterial vasodilators and/or percutaneous\ntransluminal angioplasty should be considered. Other causes of delayed neurologic deficits\nfollowing SAH include rerupture of the aneurysm, hydrocephalus, and hyponatremia. The\nfollowing SAH include rerupture of the aneurysm, hydrocephalus, and hyponatremia. The\nincidence of rerupture of an aneurysm is ~30% in the first month after presentation, with a peak\nincidence within the first 7 days. Mortality associated with rerupture is 60%. Early endovascular\ncoiling or surgical clipping of the aneurysm decreases the incidence of rerupture. Hydrocephalus\ncan occur acutely or subacutely after SAH. Subacute development of hydrocephalus is more\ncommon and presents over a few days or weeks with progressive drowsiness, incontinence, and\nslowed mentation. The patient in this scenario had a CT scan that did not show increasing blood,\ncerebral edema, or development of hydrocephalus. Hyponatremia occurs following SAH due to\nnatriuresis and volume depletion. Electrolytes are typically assessed at least twice daily following\nSAH as hyponatremia can develop fairly acutely.\nVI-95 and VI-96.    The answers are E and C, respectively. (Chap. 331) This clinical scenario\ndescribes an individual with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is an oncologic\nemergency. Eighty-five percent of cases of SVC syndrome are caused by either small-cell or\nsquamous cell cancer of the lung. Other causes of SVC syndrome include lymphoma, aortic\naneurysm, thyromegaly, fibrosing mediastinitis, thrombosis, histoplasmosis, and Behcet\nsyndrome. The typical clinical presentation is dyspnea, cough, and facial and neck swelling.\nSymptoms are worsened by lying flat or bending forward. As the swelling progresses, it can lead\nto glossal and laryngeal edema with symptoms of hoarseness and dysphagia. Other symptoms\ncan include headaches, nasal congestion, pain, dizziness, and syncope. In rare cases, seizures can\noccur from cerebral edema, although this is more commonly associated with brain metastases.\nOn physical examination, dilated neck veins with collateralization on the anterior chest wall are\nfrequently seen. There is also facial and upper extremity edema associated with cyanosis. The\ndiagnosis of SVC syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. A pleural effusion is seen in about 25% of\ncases, more commonly on the right. A chest CT would demonstrate decreased or absent contrast\nin the central veins with prominent collateral circulation and would help elucidate the cause.\nMost commonly, this would be mediastinal adenopathy or a large central tumor obstructing\nvenous flow. The immediate treatment of SVC syndrome includes oxygen, elevation of the head\nof the bed, and administration of diuretics in combination with a low-sodium diet. Conservative\ntreatment alone often provides adequate relief of symptoms and allows determination of the\nunderlying cause of the obstruction. In this case, this would include histologic confirmation of\ncell type of the tumor to provide more definitive therapy. Radiation therapy is the most common\ntreatment modality and can be used in an emergent situation if conservative treatment fails to\nprovide relief to the patient.\nVI-97.   The answer is A. (Chap. 331) This patient presents with symptoms of spinal cord compression\nin the setting of known stage IV breast cancer. This represents an oncologic emergency as only\n10% of patients presenting with paraplegia regain the ability to walk. Most commonly, patients\ndevelop symptoms of localized back pain and tenderness days to months before developing\nparaplegia. The pain is worsened by movement, cough, or sneezing. In contrast to radicular pain,\nthe pain related to spinal cord metastases is worse with lying down. Patients presenting with\nback pain alone should have a careful examination to attempt to localize the lesion prior to\ndevelopment of more severe neurologic symptoms. In this patient with paraplegia, there is a\ndefinitive level at which sensation is diminished. This level is typically one to two vertebrae\nbelow the site of compression. Other findings include spasticity, weakness, and increased deep\ntendon reflexes. In those with autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder incontinence will occur\nwith decreased anal tone, absence of the anal wink and bulbocavernosus reflexes, and bladder\ndistention. The most important initial step is the administration of high-dose intravenous\ncorticosteroids to minimize associated swelling around the lesion and prevent paraplegia while\nallowing further evaluation and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be\nperformed of the entire spinal cord to evaluate for other metastatic disease that may require\ntherapy. Although a brain MRI may be indicated in the future to evaluate for brain metastases, it\nis not required in the initial evaluation because the bilateral nature of the patient’s symptoms\nand sensory level clearly indicate the spinal cord as the site of the injury. Once an MRI is\nperformed, a definitive treatment plan can be made. Most commonly, radiation therapy is used\nwith or without surgical decompression.\nVI-98 and VI-99.    The answers are B and E, respectively. (Chap. 331) Tumor lysis syndrome occurs\nmost commonly in individuals undergoing chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating malignancies,\nincluding acute leukemias and Burkitt lymphoma. In rare instances, it can be seen in chronic\nlymphoma or solid tumors. As the chemotherapeutic agents act on these cells, there is massive\ntumor lysis that results in release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This leads to a\ncharacteristic metabolic syndrome of hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and\nhypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is frequent and can lead to renal failure requiring\nhemodialysis if uric acid crystallizes within the renal tubules. Lactic acidosis and dehydration\nincrease the risk of acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia occurs due to the release of\nintracellular phosphate ions and causes a reciprocal reduction in serum calcium. This\nhypocalcemia can be profound, leading to neuromuscular irritability and tetany. Hyperkalemia\ncan become rapidly life-threatening and cause ventricular arrhythmia. Knowing the\ncharacteristics of tumor lysis syndrome, one can attempt to prevent the known complications\nfrom occurring. It is important to monitor serum electrolytes frequently during treatment.\nLaboratory studies should be obtained no less than three times daily, but more frequent\nmonitoring is often needed. Allopurinol should be administered prophylactically at high doses. If\nallopurinol fails to control uric acid to less than 8 mg/dL, rasburicase, a recombinant urate\noxidase, can be added at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Throughout this period, the patient should be well\nhydrated with alkalinization of the urine to a pH of greater than 7.0. This is accomplished by\nadministration of intravenous normal or half-normal saline at a dose of 3000 mL/m2 daily with\nsodium bicarbonate. Prophylactic hemodialysis is not performed unless there is underlying renal\nfailure prior to starting chemotherapy.\n
