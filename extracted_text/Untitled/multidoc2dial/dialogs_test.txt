Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.)

Adoption In some cases , we can assign your adopted child a number before the adoption is complete , but you may want to wait. Then , you can apply for the number using your child's new name. If you want to claim your child for tax purposes while the adoption is still pending , contact the Internal Revenue Service for Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions. For more information, see Social Security Numbers For Children (Publication No. 05-10023).  What original documents do I need?  Citizenship We can accept only certain documents as proof of U.S. citizenship. These include a U.S. passport, Certificate of Naturalization N-550/N-570 or Certificate of Citizenship N-560/N-561.

Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview. We will ask for evidence to show that your child does not have a Social Security number. Here are examples of documents you can use to prove a Social Security number was never assigned : If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period , a current or previous passport , school and/or employment records , and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show that your child does not have a Social Security number.

Identity Your child : We can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity. An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph. We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names.

Definition of New York State Resident Section 250 5 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law defines the term' resident. ' The law defines a resident as a person who lives in NY State with the intent to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " place to live. To live in a house, a home, an apartment, a room or other similar place in NY State for 90 days is considered " presumptive evidence " that you are a resident of NY State. A police officer can use this evidence as the reason to issue a traffic ticket if you drive in NY State without a driver license or vehicle registration issued by NY State. A judge considers the law and the evidence of your intent and decides if you are a resident of NY State. For example , if you pay taxes or your children attend school in another state , a judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " residence. The DMV will not decide if you are a resident of NY State, if you must get a NY State driver license, or if you must register your vehicle in NY State. According to this law , students from other states or from other nations who attend school in NY State are normally not considered residents of NY State.

title : New CDL testing and commercial learner permit (CLP) standards#3    Document :  Overview  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA [1] has amended commercial driver license standards. This regulation is referred to as the' CDL Permit Rule' and mandated compliance by July 8 , 2015. The New York State DMV implemened the rules in phases, from April through July of 2015. We refer to the Commercial Learner Permit as " CLP ", and the Commercial Driver License as " CDL. " The changes are listed in order of implementation by the New York State DMV.  Phase 1 - April 2015  CDL skills testing changes  When you schedule or update a CDL Skills Test road test appointment , you will not be able to schedule an appointment within the first 14 days from the issuance of the CLP.  National suspension and revocation screening  The CDL Permit Rule broadens the criteria used during CLP and CDL license applications to check for open suspensions and revocations in other states. New York State will reject any application where a driver has any open suspension or revocation in any state.  Phase 2 - May 2015  Medical Certification changes  The New York State DMV will send CLP holders a notification if their medical certification status becomes " Not Certified. " Once we send the notification , we will cancel the CLP if the CLP holder does not re - certify within 55 days. We can send employers a notification of these status changes if they subscribe to the NY State License Event Notification Service LENS [2]. We will send passenger carriers enrolled in the 19-A system notifications of CLP cancellation events.  Phase 3 - June 2015  Endorsement and restriction changes  New CDL restrictions defined below by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA may affect CLP holders when taking a Skills Test in a vehicle without full airbrakes and/or a manual transmission. E - No Manual Transmission Equipped CMV L - No Airbrake Equipped CMV Z - No Full Airbrake Equipped CMV restrictions If the vehicle used for your skills test has : An automatic transmission , and this is your first road test in a commercial motor vehicle CMV , you will be given an E restriction. No form of airbrakes , and this is your first road test in a CMV , you will be given an L restriction. If you have a CDL with an L restriction and you test in a vehicle with air over hydraulic brakes , you will be upgraded from an L to a Z restriction. Also , please note that : CLPs will no longer be issued with the Double / Triple Trailer T endorsement. The T endorsement can be issued only to a driver holding a CDL. CLPs issued with a Passenger P or School Bus S endorsement will automatically get a new federally mandated " No Passengers in CMV Bus " P restriction. CLPs issued with a Tank Vehicles N endorsement will automatically get a federally mandated " No Cargo in CMV Tank Vehicle " X restriction. The P and X restrictions are issued for the CLP only. The CDL that is issued after all required tests have been passed will not have the P or X restrictions. The CDL Permit Rule added 5 new restrictions, which required New York State to change the letter assigned to existing restrictions. These restriction changes go into effect June 4 , 2015. We will send drivers a new CLP and/or CDL document with these changes printed on them after their next CLP or CDL application.  Application requirement changes  1) All CLP and CDL transactions, with the exception of replacements (duplicates) will require proof of legal presence in the United States. Drivers who can prove U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent residency will only need to provide this proof on the on or after June 18 , 2015. A record of this verification will be retained on the driver s record. Drivers with temporary visitor status will need to provide proof of legal presence in the U.S. with. Important : Because the federal regulations require submission of additional proofs in person , drivers cannot renew their CLP and/or CDL by mail. CLP and CDL documents for drivers who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents i.e., temporary visitors will have the legend NON - DOMICILED printed on documents issued on or after June 18 , 2015. The legend TEMPORARY VISITOR and the expiration date of their legal status documentation will continue to be displayed on the CLP and/or CDL document. 2) For all CLP and CDL transactions, with the exception of replacements, we will require proof of New York State residence. Proof of residence is required every time for all drivers. The DMV Document Guide [3] lists all acceptable legal presence and New York State residence proof documents.

Commercial document changes  The following federally mandated changes will be made to commercial documents CL documents will have the warning " VALID ONLY WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY A NYS LICENSE printed on them interim non - photo licenses and permits will only be valid for 60 days from the date they are issued  Phase 4 - July 2015  Suspensions and revocations (sanctions)  New York State is now required to apply federally mandated commercial suspensions and revocations to CLP holders. Federally mandated commercial suspensions and revocations that affect a driver's commercial privilege will now run consecutive one to follow the other with any other open commercial suspension or revocation on record.  New revocations  New federally mandated one year commercial revocations will be issued for drivers that are found guilty, or convicted of, falsifying, misrepresenting, or fraud in connection with an application for a CLP / CDL self - certification driving type Medical Examiner's Certificate  Commercial document changes  The following federally mandated changes will be made to commercial documents CLPs will be valid for only 180 days with one renewal for an additional 180 days, after which the holder will have to apply for a new CLP, including retaking any required knowledge tests New York State will void and return an applicant s current CLP or CDL document when issuing a new CLP / CDL document  Employer responsibilities expanded to CLP  Section 140 of the New York State Transportation Law is amended to provide that no employer will allow an employee to operate a commercial motor vehicle during any period in which the operator does not have a valid CLP or CDL does not have a CLP or CDL with the proper class or endorsement violates any restriction on the CLP or CDL has a suspended, revoked, or disqualified CLP or CDL has more than one CLP or CDL  Reference  CDL Permit Rule  You can find the 'CDL Permit Rule' in its entirety in 49 CFR Parts 383, 384, and 385 and as posted on the Federal Register (Vol. 76, No. 89 / Monday, May 9, 2011 / Rules and Regulations).

How do I get the insurance premium reduction?  The course sponsor will mail you a completion certificate within 45 business days after you complete the classroom course or 14 business days after you complete an online course. If you present your certificate to your insurance company or agent within 90 days after course completion , your liability and collision premium reduction will begin immediately, retroactive to the date you completed the course. If you present your certificate more than 90 days after course completion , the insurer may issue the premium discount effective from the date presented. If you do not receive your certificate within eight weeks after completion , immediately contact the program sponsor. You must take the course once every 36 months to maintain insurance reduction benefits.  Will the PIRP course prevent my insurance company from raising my premiums?  No. PIRP does not prevent general premium increases, or premium increases due to violations or accidents. It provides a 10% reduction for three years, from the base rate of your current liability, no - fault and collision premiums.  What if more than one person named on a policy completes the PIRP course?  Only the principal operator can receive the 10% reduction.  Will youthful drivers and drivers participating in the assigned risk pool receive the insurance premium discount?  Yes. Any insured driver who is the principal operator and completes a Point & Insurance Reduction Program course will receive the 10% reduction.  If a youthful driver is already receiving a driver education reduction, will the PIRP discount also be applied?  Contact your insurance company or agent to learn if both reductions will be given at the same time.  Learn how to reduce driving record points. [1]

title : Sharing your information#3    Document :  Does DMV sell driver license and vehicle information to others?  Yes. DMV makes driver license and vehicle registration information available for a fee using three methods: contract sales, pay - per - search and over - the - counter. Anyone who accesses DMV information must comply with the federal Driver s Privacy Protection Act [1] DPPA. The DPPA was enacted by Congress after a careful debate about why states should be allowed to share DMV data. The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver s personal information to anyone who does not have what the DPPA considers a permissible use. The DPPA defines personal information as an individual s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address, telephone number and medical information. Information on crashes, driving violations, and driver's status is not considered personal information. Social security numbers are sold.  1. Contract Sales  In accordance with the federal DPPA and NY State law , DMV sells registration and vehicle data through an open procurement process every two years. The successful bidders cannot use DMV information for any purposes other than those in connection with the issuance of a manufacturer s warranty, safety recall or similar notices important things that keep the public safe. The data can be used for statistical compilations and analysis, which do not contain any personal, identifying information. The DMV does not permit successful bidders to use the data for surveys, marketing, or solicitations. DMV collects approximately $2.2 million per year from contract sales.  2. Pay-Per-Search  To access DMV data for legitimate DPPA purposes DMV offers a pay - per - search service. In accordance with NY State law , anyone requesting access using this method must apply to DMV and sign an agreement identifying their permissible use under the DPPA. Upon verification and approval of their application , a search account is established for the requestor. The majority of search account holders are insurance companies, who must rate and monitor drivers, and investigate claims, and employers who are required to monitor their employees driving records. Each search costs $7 and is logged by DMV. Search account holders must have a DPPA permissible use for every search performed , and DMV monitors their compliance through an audit program. DMV collects approximately $58 million per year from pay - per - search sales.  3. Over-the-counter  Anyone can visit a State or County DMV office to purchase a driver license record as long as the requestor provides sufficient and specific information that identifies one and only one record, and provides a DPPA permissible use. Each over - the - counter search is $10. DMV collects approximately $3.0 million per year from over - the - counter sales.  The benefits of sharing DMV information  The DMV information shared with bus companies, employers, insurance companies, researchers, and motor vehicle manufacturers, through each of the three sharing methods, makes our lives safer and more convenient. If this information were not made available traffic safety and commerce would be negatively impacted. A few examples of how DMV s information sharing programs benefit all of us are provided below.  School Bus Drivers  School districts and private school bus companies are required to know about their drivers driving history before they hire them to transport children and other passengers. Access to DMV information enables school bus companies to make informed decisions about whom to hire. Once hired , DMV requires bus operators to conduct regular searches of their drivers records to confirm nothing negative happens during their employment that would impact their ability to safely continue to drive school buses.  Hazardous Materials Drivers  This same scenario applies to businesses transporting hazardous materials. All of us want to know the driver of a vehicle hauling dangerous materials is qualified to drive, properly trained, and possesses a valid Commercial Driver License CDL. NY State laws require hazardous material companies to only hire and employ drivers who are qualified and have valid licenses. Employers must regularly obtain their employees license records from DMV.  Insurance Companies  When you are shopping for automobile insurance on - line , you expect a rate quote within minutes. Insurance companies are able to provide this convenient service because they have direct pay - per - search access to DMV information. They check your driving history to issue an immediate rate quote. If companies could not conduct these searches , insurance companies would require you to purchase your driver record and send it to them before issuing you a quote. This practice would make it more difficult for customers to shop for affordable rates, and could increase the potential for fraudulently altered or unreliable driver records.  Motor Vehicle Manufacturers  Purchasing a used car does not automatically register you as an owner of that vehicle with the manufacturer. Manufacturers rely on DMV s contract sales program to find and notify current owners of vehicles affected by safety recalls. Recalls do not only jeopardize the safety of the owner / operator of the affected vehicle , they could also affect the safety of every other person sharing the road with that potentially unsafe vehicle. These are just a few examples of how DMV s information sharing programs are critical to improving public safety and making everyone s life more convenient. 
title : Pay suspension termination fee#1    Document :  Pay suspension termination fee[1]  A suspension means your driver license or privilege to drive is taken away for a period of time before it is returned.

Definition of Resident per Section 250 5 of the NY State Vehicle and Traffic Law : " As used in this section, the term' resident' shall mean domiciliary, that is, one who lives in this state with the intention of making it a fixed and permanent abode. It shall be presumptive evidence that a person who maintains a place of abode in this state for a period of at least ninety days is a resident of this state. " To live in a house, a home, an apartment, a room or other similar place in NY State for 90 days is considered " presumptive evidence " that you are a resident of New York State. A police officer can use this as evidence to issue a traffic ticket if you drive in New York State without a New York State driver license or vehicle registration. A judge considers the law and the evidence of your intent and decides if you are a resident of New York State. If you pay taxes or your children attend school in another state , a judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make NY State a " fixed and permanent " residence. According to this law , students from other states or from other nations who attend school in NY State are usually not considered residents of NY State. DMV does not decide if you are a resident of New York State, if you must get a New York State driver license, or if you must register your vehicle in New York State.

title : Leandra's Law & ignition interlock devices#3    Document :  What is "Leandra's Law"?  Leandra's Law was signed into law on November 18 , 2009 in honor of Leandra Rosado. Leandra was an 11-year old killed while she rode in a vehicle with the intoxicated mother of one of her friends. In response to this tragedy , the NY State Legislature made several changes to the Vehicle and Traffic Law VTL. The law strengthened the penalties against motorists who drink and drive, and requires that any person sentenced for Driving While Intoxicated on or after August 15 , 2010 must have an ignition interlock device installed on any vehicle they own or operate the driver will have an " ignition interlock " restriction added to their driver license See additional information about Leandra's Law at the NY State Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Alcohol, Drugs and Impaired Driving [1] page.  What are the different parts of Leandra's Law and what are the penalties for conviction?  Leandra's Law includes the following provisions : The law established a new Class E Felony. The law states that no person shall operate a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs while a child who is 15 years of age or younger is a passenger in the vehicle. A court must sentence a person convicted of either to a period of probation or to a conditional discharge. The court must require the installation and use of an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or operated by a person convicted under this law. The ignition interlock device must remain in the vehicle for at least 12 months, unless otherwise permitted by the court. A court that sentences a person for a conviction on or after August 15 , 2010 must impose a conditional discharge or probation , and a condition of the sentence must be the installation and use of an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle the person owns or operates. The ignition interlock device must remain in the vehicle for at least 12 months, unless otherwise permitted by the court.  What is an "ignition interlock device"?  An ignition interlock device connects to a motor vehicle ignition system and measures the alcohol content in the breath of the operator. The device prevents the vehicle from being started until the motorist provides an acceptable breath sample. If ignition interlock is ordered by a court , the system must be installed on each vehicle the motorist owns or operates. The device must remain installed for at least six months. The ignition interlock restriction will be added to the driver license record even if the license is revoked. The restriction will appear on the back of the driver license document as " interlock device ". Courts and probation departments will direct convicted motorists to vendors for ignition interlock installation. The NY State Division of Criminal Justice Services [2] website provides details on ignition interlock device vendors and information from the manufacturers of the device.  How do I remove the ignition interlock restriction from my driver license?  Your ignition interlock monitor must give you a form that states that you are no longer required to install and maintain the ignition interlock device in motor vehicles you own or operate. You must take this form to a local DMV office and apply for a new document without the restriction.

title : Closed School Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  If your school closes while you re enrolled or soon after you withdraw, you may be eligible for discharge of your federal student loan.  Learn about the eligibility requirements for discharge and how you can apply. There are certain eligibility requirements to qualify for a closed school discharge ; you must apply to get a discharge. It s important for you to obtain your academic and financial aid records if your school closes since you might need those records if you plan to attend another school or want your student loans discharged.  Discharge Criteria  You may be eligible for a 100 percent discharge of your William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loans, Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans, or Federal Perkins Loans if you were unable to complete your program because your school closed, and if you were enrolled when your school closed ; you were on an approved leave of absence when your school closed ; or your school closed within 120 days after you withdrew. You are not eligible for discharge of your loans if your school closes and any of the following is true : Except in exceptional circumstances , you withdrew more than 120 days before the school closed. You are completing a comparable educational program at another school through a teach-out, by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school , or by any other comparable means. You completed all the coursework for the program before the school closed, even if you did not receive a diploma or certificate.  Discharge Process  Contact your loan servicer about the application process for getting your loan discharged. Be sure to continue to make payments on your loan while your discharge application is being processed. Find out what happens if your loan discharge is approved. Find out what happens if your loan discharge is denied.  Automatic Closed School Discharge  If you meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge of your loans obtained to attend a school that closed on or after Nov. 1 , 2013, and you have not enrolled at another school that participates in the federal student aid programs within three years of the date your prior school closed , you will receive an automatic closed school discharge. This discharge will be initiated by the U.S. Department of Education ED , and you will be notified by your loan servicer. Although this closed school loan discharge is granted automatically after three years have passed since your school s closure , nothing prevents you from applying for and receiving a closed school discharge as soon as your school s official closure date is confirmed by ED. If you 1) attended a school that closed less than three years ago, 2) meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge, and 3) want your loans discharged, contact your loan servicer about applying for a closed school discharge now instead of waiting for three years to receive an automatic closed school discharge.  Q&A on Closed School Loan Discharges  What benefits do I have by receiving a closed school loan discharge?  By receiving a closed school loan discharge , you have no further obligation to repay the loan , you will receive reimbursement of payments made voluntarily or through forced collection , and the record of the loan and all repayment history associated with the loan, including any adverse history, will be deleted from your credit report.  I have nonfederal loans through private lenders. Can I get those loans discharged?  You will need to contact the private lender that made the loan to get that information.  I received loans for several different programs of study at the same school, but I was unable to complete any of the programs or transfer credits from one program to another before the school closed. Can all the loans be discharged?  Only loans you received for a program that you were unable to complete because of the school s closure are eligible for discharge. For example , if you initially enrolled in Program A, but decided not to continue with that program and transferred to Program B , and you were then unable to complete Program B because the school closed , only loans you received for Program B could potentially be discharged. In the example , you would not be eligible for discharge of any loans you received for Program A, because the school s closure did not prevent you from completing that program.  I did not complete the program, but I received a diploma or certificate. Does that make me ineligible for a loan discharge?  No. Before closing , some schools may issue a diploma or certificate to students who did not complete the program of study. If you did not complete your program of study , the fact that the school gave you a diploma or certificate does not disqualify you for discharge.  I transferred credits from a closed school to a completely different program of study at a new school and completed the new program. Does that make me ineligible for discharge of the loans I received at the closed school?  No. Transfer of credits from the closed school to a completely different program of study at the new school does not disqualify you for discharge.  I attended a school that is now closed. Where can I obtain a copy of my academic transcript?  Contact the state licensing agency in the state where the school was located to find out if the state has the records.  My school informed me that they have arranged a teach-out with neighboring schools. What is a teach-out?  A teach - out is a written agreement between schools that provides for the equitable treatment of students and a reasonable opportunity for students to complete their program of study if a school ceases to operate before all students have completed their program of study.  If my school closes and I then enroll in a comparable program at another school, can I still receive a discharge of the loans I received at the closed school?  It depends. If you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program of study at another school through a teach - out , by transferring academic credits or hours from the closed school, or by any other comparable means , you are not eligible for a closed school discharge. However , you may be eligible for discharge if you completed or are in the process of completing a comparable program at another school , but you did not participate in a teach - out, transfer credits or hours from the closed school, or benefit from the training you received at the closed school by any other comparable means, and if you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for a closed school discharge.

title : Receiving Financial Aid | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  Receiving Financial Aid  Your college or career school not the U.S. Department of Education will distribute your federal student aid. You ve told your school which financial aid you want to accept. Learn about when and how you will receive the aid.  When You ll Receive Your Financial Aid  The type of aid you accepted affects when you ll get your aid.  Grants and Student Loans  Generally , your school will give you your grant or loan money in at least two payments called disbursements. In most cases , your school must give you your grant or loan money at least once per term semester, trimester, or quarter. Schools that don t use traditional terms such as semesters or quarters usually must give you your grant or loan money at least twice for instance, at the beginning and midpoint of your academic year or program. Note: If you re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child s education expenses , your loan funds will be disbursed according to the same type of schedule. The following may apply if you haven t taken out a federal student loan before : If you re a first - year undergraduate student and a first - time borrower , you may have to wait 30 days after the first day of your enrollment period semester, trimester, etc. before your school is allowed to give you your loan money. Check with your school to see whether this rule applies. If you re a first - time borrower of a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan , you must complete entrance counseling before your school can give you your loan money. If you are a graduate or professional student taking out a Direct PLUS Loan for the first time , you must complete entrance counseling before you receive your first loan disbursement. Note: Counseling isn t required if you re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child s education.  Work-Study  If you re going to have a work - study job , you ll be paid at least once a month. If you don t receive the type or amount of financial aid you expected , contact your school. The financial aid office can explain how your aid was determined.  How You ll Receive Your Financial Aid  How you ll get your aid depends on the type of aid you accepted.  Grants and Student Loans  Typically , the school first applies your grant or loan money toward your tuition, fees, and if you live on campus room and board. Any money left over is paid to you directly for other education expenses. If you get your loan money , but then you realize that you don t need the money after all , you may cancel all or part of your loan within 120 days of receiving it and no interest or fees will be charged.  Work-Study  Your school must pay you directly unless you request that the school send your payments directly to your bank account or use the money to pay for education - related charges e.g., tuition, fees, room and board on your student account.  Direct PLUS Loans for Parents  In most cases , your child s school will give you your loan money by crediting it to your child s school account to pay tuition, fees, room, board, and other authorized charges. If there is money left over , the school will pay it to you. In some cases , with your permission , the school may give the leftover money to your child. If you take out a loan as a student or parent , your school or your child s school will notify you in writing each time they give you any part of your loan money. At the same time , they ll provide information about how to cancel all or part of your loan if you find you no longer need the full amount. You will also receive a notice from your loan servicer confirming that you received the loan money.  Paying for Textbooks and Other Course Materials If You Haven t Received Your Financial Aid  Schools that participate in federal student aid programs must provide a way for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term if you are eligible for disbursement i.e., the payment of your financial aid 10 days before the term begins and you will have a credit balance i.e., money left over after your financial aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges as applicable. Your school can tell you if the above criteria apply to you.  How Your School Gets Your Financial Aid Funds to You for Course Materials  You should ask your financial aid office about this because it varies from school to school. For example , if the school offers a bookstore voucher or other means for students to receive their books and supplies through the school or its bookstore , you could obtain your materials that way. When your school gives you financial aid , sometimes money is left over after your aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges. This remaining amount is called a credit balance. If you have a credit balance , your school must pay this amount to you directly within 14 days unless you authorize the school to keep the money to pay for future institutional charges. The amount the school is required to provide is either the amount of your credit balance or the amount needed for books and supplies as determined by your school, whichever is less. Your school can tell you if this applies to you. Even if the school s preferred arrangement is to provide vouchers or other means for you to get your course materials through the school or its bookstore , the school must provide you the opportunity to opt out, receive a check from the school, and obtain the books and supplies on your own unless one of the following exceptions applies : The school can demonstrate a compelling health and safety reason for obtaining the materials through the institution or its supplier. The school can demonstrate that the materials are not currently available elsewhere or accessible to students via other means. Saving Money on Textbooks and Course Materials Depending on what materials are available at your school and for your courses , you may have several lower - cost options to obtain your books : If your course uses a hard - copy textbook , consider buying a used copy or renting your textbook from a bookstore or online. If you purchase your textbook , consider reselling that textbook, if allowed, when you are done with the course. Even with new textbooks , you may be able to save money by shopping around. Some schools use open - access texts and online content to offer students further savings over hard - copy textbooks. Open - access texts are available for free. If your course uses paid online content , your school may have negotiated a deal with the publisher that will allow you online access at a fraction of the cost you would pay for a physical book. The paid online content may also come with study tools and other content in addition to the textbook. Your options for course material formats will vary by school, instructor, and course, so learning what your options are and knowing about any cost - reduction initiatives your school may have can result in significant savings. A Note About ISBNs Your school must publish the International Standard Book Number ISBN for each course text in the online course schedule entry if the ISBN is available. The ISBN identifies the specific edition of the book that s required for your class and helps you be sure you re obtaining the right book when you search for it. If an ISBN is unavailable , the school should provide the author, title, publisher, and copyright date. 
title : Understanding College Costs | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  College and career school costs can vary significantly from school to school.  Learn about college costs and get tips on how to lower costs when you go to school. The cost of college can include a variety of items including some you might not expect. By understanding college costs , you can compare schools and explore options for how to lower your costs.  What is included in the cost of college?  College costs include more than tuition and room and board. Here are common costs : Make sure colleges and career schools give you a clear statement of their tuition and fees.  How can I lower the cost of college?  Here are some suggestions on how you might be able to lower the cost of college. For many of these suggestions , you ll want to follow up with the colleges or career schools you are interested in to get additional details. Set a budget and stick to it! Having a budget will help you compare anticipated college or career school expenses against your potential available income and financial aid. You also can use a budget to compare costs between different schools. Learn about budgeting. College or career school costs can vary significantly and there are many schools with affordable tuition and generous financial assistance. Make sure to research all schools that may meet your academic and financial needs. To find colleges or career schools , use our college search tool, College Navigator. You may be able to get school credit based on your knowledge or life experiences , and you can manage your course work to reduce costs. Ask your school whether it s possible to test out of any classes. If you don t take a class , you may not have to pay for the credits. Some colleges give credit for life experiences, thereby reducing the number of credits needed for graduation. Most schools charge a set price for a specific number of credits taken in a semester. If academically possible , take the maximum number of credits allowed. This strategy reduces the amount of time needed to graduate. Some schools offer combined degree programs or three - year programs that allow you to take all of the courses needed for graduation in three years, instead of four, thereby eliminating one year's educational expenses. Colleges and career schools may offer discounts on tuition if you are a child of an alumnus or alumna i.e., if your parent went to the school ; more than one family member is enrolled at the school ; you are a student government leader or the editor of the college newspaper or yearbook ; you are an older student ; your family s main wage earner is unemployed ; or you or a member of your family works at the school. Housing costs can add up. Here are some tips for reducing your housing costs : If you go to a college or career school near home , consider living with your parents or other family. If you live off - campus , consider sharing a house or apartment with multiple housemates to cut down the cost of rent, and carpool to save on gas and parking. Most colleges and universities sponsor resident advisor programs that offer reduced tuition or reduced room and board costs if you work in a residence hall. You may be eligible for health care benefits including the following : Most young adults can stay on their parents family plan until they turn 26, even if they are married or still living with their parents. If you have been uninsured because of a pre - existing condition , you may be eligible to join the Pre - Existing Condition Insurance Plan. If you are in a new insurance plan , insurance companies cannot charge you a deductible or copays for recommended or preventive services such as flu shots or other immunizations. You can work part - time to pay part of your costs. Be sure your work and school schedules don t conflict and that you have enough time for studying. Here are a couple of options : The Federal Work - Study Program provides an opportunity to earn money while going to school. Ask schools if they participate in the program. Cooperative education programs allow students to alternate between working full - time and studying full - time. Most schools have placement offices that help students find employment and personnel offices that hire students to work on campus. Taking small steps can add up. For example , you can lower the cost of textbooks if you buy used books or rent textbooks if you won t need the books once you finish the class. A credit card can help you build a credit history, if you use it wisely. But use it for emergencies only and don t spend more than you can afford to pay. If you decide to get a credit card , make sure you understand the terms.  How can I compare the costs of colleges?  You can find information about whether the cost of a college is low, medium, or high by using the College Scorecard. Keep in mind that a higher - priced school might have more financial aid available to help you pay for your education, so take a look at the school s net price if you want an idea of how much it might cost you after financial aid is taken into account. 
title : Perkins Loan Cancellation and Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  You may be eligible to have all or a portion of your Federal Perkins Loan canceled (based on your employment or volunteer service) or discharged (under certain conditions).  Learn more to see whether you are eligible and how to apply. Federal Perkins Loan cancellation is based on eligible employment or eligible volunteer service and the length of time that you were in such a position. Discharge of your Perkins Loan may occur under certain circumstances.  Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation  What are the eligibility requirements?  You qualify for cancellation of up to 100 percent of a Federal Perkins Loan if you have served full - time in a public or nonprofit elementary or secondary school system as a teacher in a school serving students from low - income families ; special education teacher , including teachers of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities ; or teacher in the fields of mathematics, science, foreign languages, or bilingual education, or in any other field of expertise determined by a state education agency to have a shortage of qualified teachers in that state. Eligibility for teacher cancellation is based on the duties presented in an official position description, not on the position title. To receive a cancellation , you must be directly employed by the school system. There is no provision for canceling Federal Perkins Loans for teaching in postsecondary schools. Note that you also qualify for deferment while you re performing teaching service that qualifies for cancellation. Contact your college or your college s Perkins Loan servicer for information on applying for deferment.  Who is considered a teacher?  A teacher is someone including for example, a school librarian or guidance counselor who provides elementary or secondary school students with direct services directly related to classroom teaching. You do not need to be certified or licensed to receive cancellation benefits. However , your employing school must consider you to be a full - time professional for the purposes of salary, tenure, retirement benefits, etc. If you are a supervisor, administrator, researcher, or curriculum specialist , you are not considered a teacher unless you primarily provide direct and personal educational services to students.  How long must I teach?  For each full academic year or its equivalent of full - time teaching service , you are eligible to have a portion of your loan canceled. There is no requirement that you must teach a given number of hours a day to qualify as a full - time teacher ; the employing school is responsible for making that decision. An academic year or its equivalent for cancellation purposes is defined as one complete school year or two half - years that are from different school years. The two half - years must be complete and consecutive, excluding summer sessions, and must generally fall within a 12-month period.  Teaching Part-time at Multiple Schools  You can have your loan canceled if you are simultaneously teaching part - time in two or more schools if an official at one of the schools where you taught certifies that you taught full - time for a full academic year.  Teaching at a Private School  Your loan can be canceled for services performed in a private school if the private school has established its nonprofit status with the Internal Revenue Service, and if the school is providing elementary and/or secondary education according to state law.  Teaching at a Preschool or Prekindergarten Program  Your loan can be canceled only if the state considers such a program to be a part of its elementary education program. A low - income - school - directory designation that includes prekindergarten or kindergarten does not suffice for a state determination of program eligibility.  Teaching at Low-income Schools  A cancellation based on teaching in a school serving students from low - income families will be granted only if you taught in an eligible school as determined by the state education agency. To be considered a low - income school , the school must be in a school district that qualified for federal Title I funds in the year for which the cancellation is sought. Also , more than 30 percent of the school s enrollment must be made up of children in the Title I program. Each year , the U.S. Department of Education ED publishes a list of low - income elementary and secondary schools. To find out if a school is classified as a low - income school, check our online database for the year you have been employed as a teacher. Questions about the inclusion or omission of a particular school must be directed to the state education agency contact in the state where the school is located and not to ED. All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education BIE or operated on Indian reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with BIE qualify as schools serving low - income students. NOTE: If you have had a portion of your loan canceled for teaching at a low - income elementary or secondary school in one year , you can continue to have portions of your loan canceled for teaching at that school even if it is not listed as a low - income school in later years. Under certain circumstances , the institution that holds your Perkins Loan may permit retroactive cancellation if you can demonstrate that you qualified for cancellation in a prior year. However , the institution may not refund payments made during such a retroactive period.  Teaching at an Educational Service Agency  If you teach at an educational service agency , your teaching service may qualify for cancellation if the period of qualifying service includes Aug. 14 , 2008, or begins on or after that date.  Teaching Special Education  You must have an official at the public or other nonprofit elementary or secondary school certify that you are a full - time special education teacher of infants, toddlers, children, or youth with disabilities either on the deferment / cancellation form or on an official letter from the school bearing the school's seal or letterhead. If you provide one of the services listed below , you qualify as a teacher only if you are licensed, certified, or registered by the appropriate state education agency for that area in which you are providing related special educational services, and the services you provide are part of the educational curriculum for handicapped children. The services are speech and language pathology and audiology , physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychological and counseling services , and recreational therapy.  Teaching in a Designated Subject Shortage Area  This cancellation is based on full - time teaching if there is a shortage of teachers in your subject area. Each year the state education agency determines any subject shortage areas in the elementary and secondary schools within the state. Check with your local school system or state education agency to find out if your subject - matter area has been so designated. If you teach full - time in science, mathematics, foreign language, or bilingual education, you qualify for cancellation even if the state has not designated one of these subject areas as a shortage area. For a borrower to be considered as teaching in a field of expertise , the majority of classes taught must be in that field of expertise.  Nationwide Listing of Teacher Shortage Areas  You may download the list of teacher shortage areas : PDF : Teacher Shortage Areas Nationwide Listing Word file : Teacher Shortage Areas Nationwide Listing  What amount can be canceled for teaching service?  If you are eligible for cancellation under any of the categories listed above , up to 100 percent of the loan may be canceled for teaching service, in the following increments : 15 percent canceled per year for the first and second years of service 20 percent canceled for the third and fourth years 30 percent canceled for the fifth year Each amount canceled per year includes the interest that accrued during the year.  Other Employment or Volunteer Service That Qualifies for Perkins Loan Cancellation  In addition to teaching , the following employment or service may qualify you for a full or partial Perkins Loan cancellation depending on the type of loan you have and the date of the loan : Early childhood education provider Employee at a child or family services agency Faculty member at a tribal college or university Firefighter Law enforcement officer Librarian with master s degree at Title I school Military service Nurse or medical technician Professional provider of early intervention disability services Public defender Speech pathologist with master s degree at Title I school Volunteer service AmeriCorps VISTA or Peace Corps Find out how much of your loan can be canceled.  Perkins Loan Discharge  Under certain conditions , your Perkins Loan may be discharged. When your loan is discharged , it means that you are no longer obligated to pay back your loan. Conditions that may lead to discharge include the following : Bankruptcy Death School closure Service-connected disability (veterans) Spouse of a victim of the events of 9/11 Total and permanent disability  Perkins Loan Cancellation and Discharge Summary Charts  Cancellation Chart  Unless otherwise noted in the chart , the cancellation rate per completed academic year of full - time teaching or for each year of otherwise qualifying full - time service is 15 percent of the original principal loan amount for each of the first and second years ; 20 percent of the original principal loan amount for each of the third and fourth years ; and 30 percent of the original principal loan amount for the fifth year. Each amount includes the interest that accrued during each year of service. Note: As of Oct. 7 , 1998 , all Perkins Loan borrowers are eligible for all cancellation benefits regardless of when the loan was made or the terms of the borrower's promissory note. However , this benefit is not retroactive to services performed before Oct. 7 , 1998.  Discharge Chart  If your loan is discharged , you will be released from your obligation to repay the loan.  Applying for Cancellation or Discharge  Application for cancellation or discharge of a Perkins Loan must be made to the school that made the loan or to the school s Perkins Loan servicer. The school or its servicer can provide forms and instructions specific to your type of cancellation or discharge.

title : Reporting Parent Information | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  Dependent students must report their parents information, as well as their own, on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.  Find out who counts as your parent when you file your FAFSA form. If you are considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes , you will need to provide information about your legal parent on the application. A legal parent is your biological or adoptive parent, or your legal parent as determined by the state for example, if the parent is listed on your birth certificate. If you have a stepparent currently married to your legal parent , you generally also must provide information about him or her. View text-only version  Who is my parent according to the FAFSA form?  If you need to report parent information , here are some guidelines to help you : If your legal parents your biological and/or adoptive parents, or parents as determined by the state [e.g., a parent listed on your birth certificate] are married to each other, answer the questions about both of them, regardless of whether your parents are of the same or opposite sex. If your legal parents are not married to each other and live together , answer the questions about both of them, regardless of whether your parents are of the same or opposite sex. If your legal parent is widowed or was never married , answer the questions about that parent.  What if my parents are divorced or separated?  In this case , how you fill out the FAFSA form depends on whether your parents live together or not. Keep the following in mind as you read this section : For FAFSA purposes , your married parents are separated if they are considered legally separated by a state, or if they are legally married but have chosen to live separate lives, including living in separate households, as though they were not married. When two married persons live as a married couple but are separated by physical distance or have separate households , they are considered married for FAFSA purposes.  Divorced or Separated Parents Who Do Not Live Together  If your parents are divorced or separated and don t live together , answer the questions about the parent with whom you lived more during the past 12 months. If you lived the same amount of time with each divorced or separated parent , give answers about the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12 months or during the most recent 12 months that you actually received support from a parent.  Divorced or Separated Parents Who Live Together  If your divorced parents live together, you ll indicate their marital status as Unmarried and both legal parents living together , " and you will answer questions about both of them on the FAFSA form. If your separated parents live together, you ll indicate their marital status as Married or remarried " NOT Divorced or separated " , and you will answer questions about both of them on the FAFSA form.  What if I have a stepparent?  If you have a stepparent who is married to the legal parent whose information you re reporting , you must provide information about that stepparent as well. EXCEPTION : The FAFSA form asks about your parents education level. For these two questions , your parents are considered to be your birth parents or adoptive parents your stepparent is not your parent in these questions. Including your stepparent s information on the FAFSA form helps create an accurate picture of your family s total financial strength.  What if my stepparent is widowed?  If your stepparent was married to your parent but is now widowed , that stepparent doesn t count as a parent on your FAFSA form unless he or she has legally adopted you.  What if my parents are in a same-sex marriage?  Same - sex couples must report their marital status as married if they were legally married in a state or other jurisdiction foreign country, without regard to where they live or where the student will be going to school. The FAFSA questions use gender - neutral terminology for married parents Parent 1 father / mother / stepparent " and Parent 2 father / mother / stepparent " instead of mother " and father ". It does not matter which parent completes which set of questions.  What if I live with someone other than my parents?  It doesn t matter if you don t live with your parent or parents ; you still must report information about them. The following people are not your parents unless they have legally adopted you: grandparents, foster parents, legal guardians, older brothers or sisters, uncles or aunts, and widowed stepparents.  What kind of information must my parents provide for the FAFSA form?  For each parent , you ll report similar information to that you report for yourself: basic information about your parent s identity e.g., name, date of birth, and Social Security number if he or she has one; living situation e.g., marital status, state of residence, household size; and financial circumstances e.g., tax information, certain assets, certain untaxed income. Learn more about the types of information you and your parents will report on the FAFSA form.  What if I'm unable to provide parent information due to special circumstances?  In situations such as the ones below , you may be able to submit your FAFSA form without parent information despite being considered a dependent student : Your parents are incarcerated. You have left home due to an abusive family environment. You do not know where your parents are and are unable to contact them and you have not been adopted. You are older than 21 but not yet 24, are unaccompanied, and are either homeless or self - supporting and at risk of being homeless. If you are filling out the FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid app , you will be asked whether you are able to provide information about your parents. If you are not , you will have the option to indicate that you have special circumstances that make you unable to get your parents information. You will then be able to submit your application without entering data about your parents. However , it is important for you to understand the following : Although your FAFSA form will be submitted , it will not be fully processed. You will not receive an Expected Family Contribution EFC and must immediately contact the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. The financial aid staff may ask for additional information to determine whether you can be considered independent and have an EFC calculated without parent data. Gather as much written evidence of your situation as you can. Written evidence may include court or law enforcement documents; letters from a clergy member, school counselor or social worker; and/or any other relevant data that explains your special circumstance. The financial aid office s decision about your dependency status is final and cannot be appealed to the U.S. Department of Education.  What if my parents are unwilling to provide their information on my FAFSA form?  You can t be considered independent of your parents just because they refuse to help you with the FAFSA form. Still , we do understand that in some cases, the parents are not supporting the dependent student at all and refuse to provide their information on the student s application. If you re in that situation , here s the process for filling out the FAFSA form online or on the myStudentAid app : When the FAFSA form asks you to provide information about your parents , select the I am unable to provide information about my parent option. If you are using the myStudentAid app, you will need to select the Learn more link when you get to the point in the app where it tells you that it looks like parent information is required to calculate your EFC. You will then be provided with an explanation of what s considered a special circumstance. After reading through the options , select the one that says you don t have a special circumstance but you still can t provide parent information. If you are using the myStudentAid app, you will need to select the option indicating that you d like to be considered for an unsubsidized loan. The application explains that if your parents don t support you and refuse to provide their information on the application, you may submit your FAFSA form without their information. However , you won t be able to get any federal student aid other than an unsubsidized loan and even that might not happen. The decision is up to the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend. If you agree to this , you may submit your FAFSA form without parent information. Your FAFSA information will be sent to the colleges you list , but you won t get an EFC. You must immediately contact your school s financial aid office to discuss the possibility of getting an unsubsidized loan. The financial aid office may ask for a written statement from your parents, indicating that they refuse to provide their information on the FAFSA form and that they no longer support you. Forms of support include allowing you to live in their home, including you on their car or health insurance, providing a car to drive on a regular basis, and payment of your tuition or fees. The financial aid office will look at your situation and decide whether you may receive an unsubsidized loan. That decision is final and cannot be appealed to the U.S. Department of Education. If you re considering following this process, think about this first : If you submit your FAFSA form without parent information, you will not receive an EFC. Some state- or school - based aid programs look at the EFC in order to determine your eligibility for their funds ; because you won t have an EFC, you won t be considered for those aid programs. You could be giving up a chance at many sources of aid. So encourage your parents to provide their information doing so won t require them to support you in any way , it ll just help you be considered for as many sources of financial aid as possible.  What if my parents are concerned about providing their information because of their citizenship status?  Your parents citizenship status does not affect your eligibility for federal student aid. In fact , the FAFSA form doesn t even ask about your parents status.  How should we report information about my noncitizen parents on my FAFSA form?  Here are some tips for students with noncitizen parents : If your parent does not have a Social Security number SSN , you should enter all zeroes for him or her on the FAFSA form where it asks for that information. Do NOT enter a Taxpayer Identification Number in the SSN field. If your parent doesn t have an SSN , he or she won t be able to create an FSA ID which requires an SSN and therefore won t be able to sign your FAFSA form electronically either online or via the myStudentAid app. From the online form you can t print a signature page from the app , you ll need to select the option to print a signature page when you get to the end of the application. Print the page, have your parent sign it, and then mail it to the address indicated so that your FAFSA form can be processed. If your parent doesn't live in the U.S. , select " Foreign Country " from the dropdown box for the question that asks about the parents' state of legal residence. If your parents live and file taxes in a foreign country and don t file U.S. taxes , you ll have the opportunity to indicate that they have filed their taxes. Then , when the FAFSA form asks whether your parents filed a Puerto Rican or foreign tax return , you should select Yes. " Convert the amounts on the foreign tax return into U.S. dollars as directed by the FAFSA help and hints. If your parents live in one of the Freely Associated States , they should enter the Amount of Wages Earned from their Freely Associated States tax form in the field where the FAFSA form asks for adjusted gross income. If your parent doesn t file taxes at all , select Not going to file " for the question that asks whether the parent have filed taxes. Then you ll be asked for information about how much your parent earned from work, rather than being asked for information about specific items on the tax form. 
title : Choosing a School | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  Not sure what college or career school might be right for you?  Learn about steps you can take to research possible colleges or career schools. While getting the right education and training will help you get a better - paying job , going to college or career school is a big investment in time, money, and effort. Make sure to take your time and research your options.  How do I find the right college or career school for me?  Types of Schools  There is a wide array of schools available for higher education. Options include two- and four - year colleges and universities, vocational, trade, and career schools, online schools, and graduate schools. Different schools serve different purposes. Make sure you choose the type of school that helps you achieve your goals. Remember that financial assistance programs and requirements can vary from school to school. Plus , not all colleges and career schools participate in the federal student aid programs. Always check with a school to find out what financial aid is available there.  Assess Yourself  Understanding your career goals and options and their earning potential will help you find a college or career school that meets your needs. The Career Search will help you match your skills and interests with potential careers.  Use the College Search Tool  The U.S. Department of Education s college search tool, College Navigator, is a way to find colleges and career schools that may fit your needs. You can search for schools by location, degrees offered, programs and majors, tuition and fees, setting, size, and much more. College Navigator allows you to compare schools, save your session, and export your results into a spreadsheet.  Check Out Schools (In Person or Remotely)  To help you narrow down your college or career school options , try the following : Check out the school s website. Lots of colleges and career schools offer virtual tours, so you can still see the campus, even if you can t visit in person. Attend college fairs. College fairs give you the chance to talk to representatives from multiple colleges and career schools. For instance , you can visit the National Association for College Admission Counseling college fairs. A great way to get a feel for a school is to contact the school and schedule a visit, preferably while classes are in session. Be sure to bring a list of questions to ask. If you re in high school , ask your school counselor what information he or she has about the schools that interest you. Visit your state higher education agency s website to learn more about colleges and universities in your state. Your education is a major investment, so find out as much information as you can before you enroll. And because each school may offer different financial aid packages , you should consider applying to more than one school. For more information about what you should be doing to get ready for college , use our checklists for help.  What should I consider when comparing schools?  As you research colleges and career schools , consider such factors as cost, location, accreditation, and more. To find the information listed on this page for a specific school , check the school s website or search for the school using the U.S. Department of Education s college search tool, College Navigator.  School Costs and Net Price  School costs can be one of the most important factors in choosing potential colleges or career schools and costs can vary significantly from school to school. Learn about what is included in the cost of college and ways to reduce college costs. Any school that participates in the federal student aid programs is required to provide information on its cost of attendance and to offer a net price calculator on its website. Searching for a school s net price calculator is easy. This calculator will give you an idea of how much a program may cost after subtracting any financial aid. You can look up the cost and assess the value of colleges using the College Scorecard.  Financial Aid  Many students worry that tuition and the other costs of continuing their education will be out of reach. But don t let the potential costs stop you. Most students receive some kind of financial aid , and a few students even get a free ride, with all their costs covered. You should learn about financial aid including grants, scholarships, work - study, and loans. Always apply for all types of aid for which you might qualify, and meet all deadlines! Creating and managing a budget is a way to keep track of your income and expenses and save for your goals.  Admission Requirements  Different schools have different admission requirements. Learn exactly what a school requires by visiting its website or checking in with its admissions office. Many U.S. colleges require that students submit standardized test scores as part of their application packages. For most undergraduate programs , you ll have to take either the SAT or the ACT Test.  Accreditation  An accredited school meets certain standards set by an independent agency. It helps ensure the training or education you get meets employer standards in a specific field. If you attend a school that isn t accredited , you might not be able to get any financial aid. Use our accreditation search page to check a particular school s standards or to find an accredited school in a particular field or location. A diploma mill is an unaccredited school or a business claiming to be a school that awards a degree without requiring classwork that meets college - level standards. Some will send a diploma without you doing any work at all if you pay a fee. Others assign classwork that is so easy that your resulting degree is worthless, compared to a degree from an accredited school, and it won t help you get a good job. Learn more about diploma mills and how to avoid them.  Enrollment Contracts  Read any school enrollment contract carefully before you sign it. The contract explains what the school will give you for your money. If a school representative promises you something such as help finding a job that s not in the contract , ask the representative to write that promise into the contract and have it signed and dated. A promise is usually not enforceable unless it s in writing.  Refund Policies  Find out the school s tuition refund policy. If you enroll but never begin classes , you should get most of your money back. If you begin attending classes but leave before completing your course work , you might be able to get some of your money back. Also find out the school s return - of - aid policy. If you receive federal student aid except for Federal Work - Study and you withdraw from school , some of that money might have to be given back to the source by you or by your school. Even if you don t finish your course work , you ll have to repay the loan funds you received, minus any student loan funds your school has returned to the U.S. Department of Education. Learn more about repaying federal student loans.  Past Complaints and Reputation  Just because a school participates in the federal student aid programs doesn t mean we ve endorsed the quality of education the school offers. To find out whether there have been any complaints about the school , contact your local Better Business Bureau, state higher education agency, or the consumer protection division of your state attorney general s office. Check with the agency that licenses or accredits the school to see whether it meets required standards.  Useful Statistics  Some numbers can help you evaluate schools.

Who Qualifies for Borrower Defense to Repayment Loan Forgiveness  Under the law , you may be eligible for borrower defense to repayment forgiveness of the federal student loans that you took out to attend a school if that school misled you, or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws. Specifically , you may assert borrower defense by demonstrating that the school, through an act or omission, violated state law directly related to your federal student loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. You may be eligible for borrower defense regardless of whether your school closed or you are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under other laws. If you are eligible to receive federal student loan forgiveness , you may be able to have all or part of your outstanding federal student loan debt forgiven , and you also may be reimbursed for amounts you have already paid on those loans. You will only be eligible for this type of federal student loan forgiveness if your school s misleading activities or other misconduct directly relate to the loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. You will not be eligible for this type of forgiveness based on claims that are not directly related to your loan or the educational services provided by the school. For example , personal injury claims or claims based on allegations of harassment are not bases for a borrower defense application. Please note that eligibility for federal student loan forgiveness is limited to federal student loans taken out for payment to the school relating to your borrower defense application. If you would like to apply for borrower defense against multiple schools that you attended and for which you took out federal student loans , you must submit separate applications for each school of attendance. For the purposes of borrower defense discharge only , we interpret the term Direct Loan in 34 CFR 685.206 to include Direct Consolidation loans. This interpretation enables borrowers with loans eligible for Direct Loan consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans or Federal Perkins Loans, to avail themselves of the borrower discharge process provided here by consolidating such loans into the Direct Loan Program.  Forbearance/Stopped Collections Status  Within the application , you may select to have your federal student loans placed into forbearance or stopped collections status while your application is reviewed by ED. If you choose for your loans to be placed into forbearance or stopped collections status, shortly after we receive your application , your loans will be placed in forbearance , and collections will cease on any of your loans that are in default while your application is evaluated. NOTE: If you do not select one of the forbearance or stopped collection options within the application, your federal student loans will be placed into forbearance or stopped collection , and ED will request forbearance or stopped collection for any commercially held Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans that you have currently. Interest will continue to accrue for the loans in forbearance while your application is evaluated. More information on forbearance and stopped collections is available immediately below in the Common Questions and Answers Regarding Forbearance / Stopped Collections section. Automatic Administrative Forbearance and Temporary 0% Interest as a Result of the COVID-19 National Emergency To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency , federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payments. In addition , interest is being temporarily set at 0% on federal student loans. This 0% interest and suspension of payments will last from March 13 , 2020, through Sept. 30 , 2020 , but you can still make payments if you choose. Have questions? Find out what loans qualify, and get additional information about the 0% interest period, administrative forbearance, and other student loan flexibilities due to the COVID-19 national emergency.  Common Questions and Answers Regarding Forbearance/Stopped Collections Status  By completing and submitting a borrower defense application , you may have all of your federal student loans in repayment placed into forbearance status and have debt collections on any federal student loans in default stopped stopped collections status while ED reviews your application. However , please note interest will continue to accumulate on federal student loans regardless of what status they are in, including for subsidized loans. If your application for borrower defense is denied or partially approved , then when you are taken out of forbearance or stopped collections , the interest that accumulated will be added to the amount you owed when you entered forbearance or stopped collections , and the total amount you owe in the future may be higher. NOTE : You do not have to place your loans in forbearance or stopped collections to apply for borrower defense forgiveness. If you do not select one of the forbearance or stopped collection options within the application , your ED - held Federal Student Aid loans will automatically be placed into forbearance and stopped collections , and ED will request forbearance and debt collection to stop for any commercially held FFEL Program loans that you have currently as applicable. Please read the following question and answer Q & A section carefully before you choose whether you want the U.S. Department of Education to place your loans into forbearance or stopped collections. What does forbearance status mean? During any period that your federal student loans are in forbearance , you do not have to make payments on those loans , and the loans will not go into default. This will continue until the borrower defense review process of your application is completed. Your loan servicer will notify you when your federal student loan have been placed into forbearance status. Until you receive that notice , you must continue to make payments. What does stopped collections status mean? During any period that your loans are in default , if you choose to enter stopped collections status , collections on your loans will stop. For federal student loans that are placed into stopped collections status , the federal government or debt collection companies will stop attempting to collect on the loan, including by not withholding money from your wages or income tax refunds. This will continue until the borrower defense review process of your application is completed. If you previously defaulted on your federal student loan and have entered a rehabilitation plan , please contact the collection agency that you have been working with to set up that plan in order to determine whether there may be any negative consequences if you choose to enter stopped collections status. Which of my federal student loans are eligible to go into forbearance or stopped collections status? Initially , if you choose forbearance or stopped collections status , it will affect all of your federal student loans that are owned by ED and are being serviced by your federal student loan servicer, including loans that are not eligible for borrower defense loan forgiveness, such as 1 loans taken out to attend another institution, and 2 any loans you have for which you are not asserting borrower defense. If you select forbearance and you have commercially held FFEL Program loans , ED will request forbearance on your behalf. Can I remove some or all of my federal student loans from forbearance or stopped collections status? If you want the forbearance or stopped collections status to apply only to those federal student loans related to your borrower defense application , you must contact your loan servicer after you hear from your loan servicer and your servicer confirms the forbearance or stopped collection status. After your loans enter forbearance or stopped collection status , if at any time you want to remove all of your federal student loans from forbearance or stopped collections , you must also contact your loan servicer. Can I make payments on my federal student loans that are in forbearance or stopped collections? Yes. While your federal student loans are in forbearance or stopped collections , you are not required to pay your loans. However , you are allowed to make payments on any of your loans that are in forbearance or stopped collections, including payments for accrued interest. As noted above , interest will continue to accrue on all of these loans while they are in forbearance or stopped collections. What happens if my borrower defense application against the school is successful? Your federal student loans related to your application may be discharged partially or completely. If you receive a partial discharge , you will be responsible for repaying any amounts that are not discharged through borrower defense including any interest that accumulated. Also , at that time , the forbearance or stopped collections period for any of your other federal student loans will end. You will be responsible for repaying those other loans, if applicable, including interest that accrued during the forbearance or stopped collections period. What happens if my borrower defense application against the school is denied? You will not receive a discharge of any of your federal student loans and the forbearance or stopped collections period will end for all of your loans. You will be responsible for repaying these loans, including interest that accrued during the forbearance or stopped collections period. Q. I believe I may be a member of the class that has been certified in the case, Manriquez v. DeVos, because my borrower defense application includes a claim that is based upon job placement rate misrepresentations made by a Corinthian Colleges school. What happens with my repayment status , and what should I do if I am in the wrong repayment status? For more information about the Manriquez v. DeVos case and the class that has been certified in that case , go to the Information About Debt Relief for Corinthian Colleges Students page, under the Information on Pending Litigation for Students at Corinthian Colleges Everest, Heald, and WyoTech Under Borrower Defense to Repayment Rule section. The Frequently Asked Questions About Manriquez v. DeVos subsection provides additional information on how forbearance and stopped collections may apply to your situation due to the pending litigation and court injunction and on what to do if you have questions about your repayment status. The Notifications Regarding Manriquez v. DeVos Lawsuit section on this page provides information about notifications ED began emailing and mailing to borrowers on Dec. 26 , 2019.  Common Questions and Answers Regarding Borrower Defense Decision Notifications  The U.S. Department of Education ED notifies borrower defense applicants of ED s determination about borrower defense discharge eligibility. The notifications are emailed to borrowers. If you have questions about your notification email that aren t answered below , call our borrower defense hotline : 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207. Representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time ET. Q. I received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is approved. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application for a borrower defense discharge of your Direct Loans under the applicable borrower defense to repayment rules and determined that your claim associated with your enrollment or your child s enrollment at the school identified in that notification email is approved. Your borrower defense application was evaluated based on the applicable state law and the circumstances identified in your notification email. Your notification email identified the percentage of the total amount of the Direct Loans you took out to pay for your program that will be discharged. You should receive notification of your discharge from your federal loan servicer within 90 120 days after you received your notification email. As explained in the What happens next? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification of your discharge from your federal loan servicer. Does the borrower defense discharge apply to all loans I took out to pay for my program? No. This borrower defense discharge applies only to your Direct Loans. This borrower defense discharge does not apply to private student loans or other loans you may have received from programs administered by federal or state agencies, including other programs administered by ED. ED will proceed with the applicable discharge of your Direct Loans. If some of your federal student loans are Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans and/or Federal Perkins Loan Program loans , they are not eligible for discharge under the Borrower Defense to Repayment law or regulations. If you want to have your borrower defense discharge apply to your FFEL and/or Federal Perkins loans , you can consolidate your loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and obtain the discharge. To apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan , go to StudentAid.gov/app/launchConsolidation.action. Once you have your Direct Consolidation Loan , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday to proceed with discharge. How did ED determine my discharge percentage? For approved borrower discharge claims , ED calculated the amount of borrower defense discharge relief by comparing the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at a borrower s school median program earnings to the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at other schools median comparison earnings. Specifically , ED used a statistical tool called standard deviation to identify the range of program earnings that would qualify for loan relief, and then divided that range into quartiles to determine the amount of relief a borrower would be provided. If your program earnings exceeded the comparison earnings , then , even if you filed an approved claim , you will not receive a discharge unless your approved application is associated with Corinthian Colleges, Inc. CCI. If your approved application is associated with CCI , you will receive at least a 10% discharge. The larger the negative gap between your program earnings and comparison earnings , the greater the amount of loan discharge you received. The Borrower Defense Partial Relief Methodology tables used by ED to determine relief percentages are provided for your reference. When viewing the earnings charts , note the following : No Data Available appears when there was no data available to complete a calculation. The wording under Program Name may not match exactly to the program name used by your school. There can be slight wording differences in the program name used by the school and the program name shown in the earnings chart. The word Diploma under the Credential column , means the same as Certificate Program, which is often used by schools. Will prior payments be refunded after my discharge is applied? A time limitation applies on receiving a refund of payments made on your federal student loans when a borrower defense claim is approved. We will inform your loan servicer whether you filed your borrower defense to repayment application within the applicable number of years of separating from leaving your school. One of two things will happen. If you filed your application within the applicable limitation period and your loan payments exceed the amount owed after your discharge is applied , you will be eligible for a refund of payments. Your loan servicer will apply the borrower defense discharge to your student loan account and then determine whether you still have an outstanding amount balance due on any Direct Loans. If a balance remains on your account after your discharge is applied , your servicer will apply any prior payments made on the discharged loans first to the remaining balance of your discharged loans and then to the balance of other Direct Loans on your account. If no balance remains on your account , your servicer will return the refund amount to you. If you filed your application outside the applicable limitation period or your loan payments are less than the amount owed after your discharge is applied , you will not be eligible for a refund of payments. Your loan servicer will not apply any prior payments made on the discharged loans or return any refund amount to you. Your loan servicer will let you know if you are eligible or ineligible for a refund of payments. Will interest be waived in addition to my discharge? For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. Your federal loan servicer will let you know what your remaining balance is after the interest waiver has been applied. Note: If you receive a 100% discharge , you do not receive a separate interest waiver because your entire loan balance, including any interest, is discharged. Q. I m a CCI borrower and received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is ineligible for relief. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application under the applicable Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations for discharge of your Direct Loans made in connection with your or your child s enrollment at a school operated by CCI, including Everest Institute, Everest College, Everest University, Heald College, and WyoTech. ED has determined that your application is ineligible for relief based on review of the facts of your claim and the regulatory criteria for relief ; this decision means that your Direct Loans will not be discharged. ED s reasons for this determination are as follows : Applicable Law For Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1 , 2017 , a borrower may be eligible for a discharge forgiveness of part or all of one or more Direct Loans if the borrower s school engaged in acts or omissions that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable state law. See 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended , 20 U.S.C. 1087e , and 34 CFR 685.206 and 685.222 the Borrower Defense regulations. ED recognizes a borrower s defense to repayment of a Direct Loan only if the cause of action directly relates to the Direct Loan or to the school s provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was provided. 34 CFR 685.206 , 685.222 ; U.S. Department of Education, Notice of Interpretation , 60 Fed. Reg. 37,769 July 21 , 1995. Borrower Defense Claims Based on CCI Job Placement Rates ED has determined that students who first enrolled in certain programs at certain schools operated by CCI between 2010 and 2014 have borrower defense claims arising from the publication of misleading job placement rates for many of their programs of study and are eligible for a discharge of part or all of their loans under ED s Borrower Defense regulation. Lists of covered programs and time periods are available for Everest / WyoTech and Heald the covered programs. In order to have a successful borrower defense claim based on ED s CCI findings , you must have enrolled in one of the covered programs during a listed time period. ED has established a process for the review of borrower defense to repayment claims for job placement rates asserted by borrowers enrolled in the covered programs at CCI schools during the eligibility period. Each CCI borrower s application is reviewed under the same process to determine whether the borrower qualifies for borrower defense to payment relief based on a CCI school job placement rate claim. Why was my CCI application determined to be ineligible? A. ED reviewed your application regarding the campuses you attended, the programs in which you enrolled, and the dates that you enrolled. ED also reviewed data from the National Student Loan Data System NSLDS database and, if available, school - provided data regarding your programs and enrollment dates, in addition to the enrollment information on any official school documents that you provided with your application. You includes your child if you are a Direct PLUS Loan borrower who requested a discharge for loans taken out to pay for a child s enrollment at a CCI - operated institution. Based on that review , ED has determined that you did not enroll in a covered program at a CCI school during the eligibility period. Either a the initial enrollment dates or programs you provided in your application fell outside the eligibility period for a covered program at one or more of the CCI campuses or b both NSLDS data and the school s data demonstrated that you were not enrolled in a covered program at one or more of the CCI schools during the eligibility period. Moreover , your borrower defense application did not describe any other act or omission by the CCI schools that related to the making of your Direct Loans for enrollment or the provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was made and that would be actionable under state law. Accordingly , ED has determined that your borrower defense to repayment application is ineligible and will not discharge your Direct Loans. Your borrower defense application was evaluated based on California state law and the circumstances identified in your notification email. For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. As explained in the What should I do now? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification from your federal loan servicer. If you disagree with this decision , you can ask ED to reconsider your borrower defense application. Q. I m a non - CCI borrower and received an email saying that my borrower defense claim is ineligible for relief. Is this email legitimate? Yes. ED completed its review of your application under the applicable Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations for discharge of your Direct Loans made in connection with your or your child s enrollment at the school identified in that notification email. ED has determined that your application is ineligible for relief based on review of the facts of your claim and the regulatory criteria for relief ; this decision means that your Direct Loans will not be discharged. Applicable Law For Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1 , 2017 , a borrower may be eligible for a discharge forgiveness of part or all of one or more Direct Loans if the borrower s school engaged in acts or omissions that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable state law. See 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended , 20 U.S.C. 1087e , and 34 CFR 685.206 and 685.222 the Borrower Defense regulations. ED recognizes a borrower s defense to repayment of a Direct Loan only if the cause of action directly relates to the Direct Loan or to the school s provision of educational services for which the Direct Loan was provided. 34 CFR 685.206 , 685.222 ; U.S. Department of Education, Notice of Interpretation , 60 Fed. Reg. 37,769 July 21 , 1995. Why was my non - CCI application determined to be ineligible? A. ED reviewed your borrower defense claim based on any evidence submitted by you in support of your application, your loan data from the NSLDS database, as well as evidence gathered from the sources identified in your notification email. Each allegation of misconduct you claimed is identified in your email along with the reason that claim failed. For borrower defense applications received by ED on or before Jan. 1 , 2020 , ED will waive interest on the federal student loans that it holds for the period between the date you submitted your borrower defense application and the date of your notification email. ED is waiving interest in these cases because of the extended period of time it took to review claims. As explained in the What should I do now? section of your email notification , wait to receive notification from your federal loan servicer. If you disagree with the percentage discharge determined under the formula or with other parts of this decision , you can ask ED to reconsider your borrower defense application. Q. I received more than one notification email about my borrower defense claim. Should this have happened? There are two circumstances that would result in your receipt of more than one notification email. If you have two email addresses associated with your borrower defense application , ED sent a notification email to both addresses. If you have a borrower defense application that was approved and a different borrower defense application that was determined to be ineligible , ED sent you a notification email specific to each application. To check the notification emails you received , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday. What if I don t agree with the decision made regarding my borrower defense claim? If you disagree with ED s decision , you can ask ED to reconsider your borrower defense application. You can do so in one of two ways : Send a new email with the subject line Request for Reconsideration to BorrowerDefense@ed.gov. Include the number that appears with the words Request for Reconsideration in the What if I don t agree with this decision? section of your notification email. Mail your request to U.S. Department of Education, P.O. Box 1854 , Monticello, KY 42633. In your request for reconsideration , provide the following information : What you think was decided incorrectly Why you believe the decision was incorrect that you believe establishes that you are eligible for a different decision Any evidence We will not accept any request for reconsideration that includes new allegations of misconduct by your school. If you include new allegations of misconduct by your school in your reconsideration request , the request will be rejected. You must file a new application regarding acts or omissions by your school other than those described in the borrower defense application identified in your notification email, by submitting an application. In the new application , you should explain in the relevant sections the basis for any new borrower defense claims and submit all supporting evidence. ED will not place your federal student loans into forbearance or stopped collection activity when you file a request for reconsideration. In addition , if your borrower defense claim was approved , ED will not begin its review of your request for reconsideration until your federal loan servicer notifies you that the discharge has been completed. For more information about reconsideration , contact our borrower defense hotline at 1 - 855 - 279 - 6207 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday. Can I apply for borrower defense if I have additional allegations? Yes. If you wish to file a new application regarding acts or omissions by your school other than those described in the borrower defense application identified in your notification email , submit an application. In the new application , you should explain in the relevant sections the basis for any new borrower defense claims and submit all supporting evidence. What should I know about repayment? A. ED offers a variety of loan repayment options, including standard, graduated, and extended repayment plans, which base your payment on your loan balance and interest rate, as well as income driven repayment plans, which base your payment on your income. Remember , that while you can choose a repayment plan that lowers your monthly payment amount, it may also increase the amount of interest you pay over time which sometimes is significantly more. For more information about student loan repayment options , visit StudentAid.gov/plans. If you don t begin or resume repayment when required , your loans may be placed into default. Defaulting on your loans subjects you to collection activity that includes administrative wage garnishment taking money out of your pay ; you may be owed offset of state and federal payments taking money owed to you by the government ; and litigation taking legal action against you.  Borrower Defense Discharge Earnings Information  The U.S. Department of Education ED notifies borrower defense applicants about its review of their claims for discharge. Some claims are approved for discharge and other claims are determined to be ineligible for discharge. For approved borrower discharge claims , ED calculates the amount of borrower defense discharge relief by comparing the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at a borrower s school median program earnings to the earnings of those who completed the same or a similar program at other schools median comparison earnings. Specifically , ED uses a statistical tool called standard deviation to identify the range of program earnings that would qualify for loan relief, and then divides that range into quartiles to determine the amount of relief a borrower would be provided. If your program earnings exceed the comparison earnings , then , even if you filed an approved claim , you will not receive a discharge unless your approved application is associated with Corinthian Colleges, Inc. CCI. If your approved application is associated with CCI , you will receive at least a 10% discharge. The larger the negative gap between your program earnings and comparison earnings , the greater the amount of loan discharge you receive. The Borrower Defense Partial Relief Methodology tables used by ED to determine relief percentages are provided for your reference. When viewing the earnings charts , note the following : No Data Available appears when there was no data available to complete a calculation. The wording under Program Name may not match exactly to the program name used by your school. There can be slight wording differences in the program name used by the school and the program name shown in the earnings chart. The word Diploma under the Credential column , means the same as Certificate Program, which is often used by schools. Corinthian Colleges , Inc. CCI Programs ITT Educational Services , Inc. Programs  Notifications Regarding Sweet v. DeVos Lawsuit  In June and early July 2020 , the U.S. Department of Education ED will email and mail notifications about the Sweet v. DeVos lawsuit to borrower defense applicants who are potential members of the group of borrowers to whom the lawsuit applies to inform them that there is a proposed settlement of the lawsuit. The settlement will not become final until it is approved by the court as fair, adequate, and reasonable. The notification describes how borrowers legal rights may be affected by the settlement. ED will send borrowers two notifications one by email and one by mail. The email notifications will be sent to borrowers from the email address noreply@studentaid.gov. The mailed notifications will be sent to borrowers in an envelope marked with Federal Student Aid s return address. If you have questions about notifications you receive that aren t answered below , there s more information about the Sweet v. DeVos lawsuit on Class Counsel s website at predatorystudentlending.org/sweet-v-devos-class-members/. Q. I received an email from noreply@studentaid.gov and/or a letter saying that I may be part of a group of borrowers under a lawsuit called Sweet v. DeVos. Are these communications legitimate? Yes. The case Sweet v. DeVos , No. 19-cv-3674 (N.D. Cal. ), is a lawsuit that was filed in a federal court in California by seven borrower defense applicants who represent, with certain exceptions, all borrowers with pending borrower defense applications as of April 7, 2020. The lawsuit challenges the fact that ED did not issue a final decision on any borrower defense applications from any school between June 2018 and December 2019. The lawsuit is ONLY about the fact that final decisions were not issued during that period of time, NOT whether those applications should result in loan cancellation or not. Now , both parties are proposing to settle this lawsuit. This proposed settlement is a compromise of disputed claims , and ED continues to deny that it has acted unlawfully. Who is included in the group of people the class represented by Sweet v. DeVos? The case Sweet v. DeVos includes all people who borrowed a Direct Loan or FFEL loan to pay for a program of higher education, who have asserted a borrower defense to repayment to the U.S. Department of Education, whose borrower defense has not been granted or denied on the merits, and who is not a class member in Manriquez v. DeVos, No. 17-cv-7210 (N.D. Cal. What are the terms of the proposed settlement? In the proposed settlement , ED agrees to resolve pending borrower defense applications of people who have borrower defense applications pending as of April 7 , 2020, on the following terms : ED will approve or deny all Sweet class members pending borrower defense applications within 18 months of when the settlement agreement is approved by the court. ED will notify you of whether your claim was approved, whether you will receive any loan cancellation, and if so, how much loan cancellation you will receive. If your application is approved and you are entitled to any loan discharge , ED will complete the process of canceling some or all of your outstanding loan debt within 21 months of the date on which the settlement agreement is approved by the court. ED will provide your lawyers with information about its progress making borrower defense decisions every three months, including how many decisions ED has made, how many borrowers have received a loan discharge, and any new borrower defense findings ED has made. ED confirms, consistent with governing law and existing policies, that if you are in default, it will not take action to collect your debt, such as by garnishing your wages that is, taking part of your paycheck or taking portions of your tax refund, while your application is pending. A copy of the proposed settlement is available online at predatorystudentlending.org/cases/sweet-v-devos. What will happen next? The court will need to approve the proposed settlement before it becomes final. The court will hold a public hearing, called a fairness hearing, to decide if the proposed settlement is fair. The hearing will be held on Oct. 1 , 2020, beginning at 8 a.m. Pacific time at the following address : United States District Court Northern District of California 450 Golden Gate Avenue , Courtroom 12 , 19th Floor San Francisco, CA 94102 What should I do in response to this notice? IF YOU AGREE with the proposed settlement , you do not have to do anything. You have the right to attend the fairness hearing, at the time and place above, but you are not required to do so. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH OR HAVE COMMENTS on the proposed settlement , you can write to the court or ask to speak at the hearing. You must do this by writing to the Clerk of the Court, at the following mailing address : Clerk of the Court United States District Court Northern District of California 450 Golden Gate Avenue San Francisco , CA 94102 Your written comments or request to speak at the fairness hearing must be postmarked by Aug. 20 , 2020. The Clerk of the Court will provide copies of the written comments to the lawyers who brought the lawsuit. Who are the lawyers for the Sweet v. DeVos class and how can I contact them? The class is represented by the Legal Services Center at Harvard Law School and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates. If you have questions about this lawsuit or about the proposed settlement , please visit their Frequently Asked Questions page at predatorystudentlending.org/sweet-v-devos-class-members/, which also has contact information for the lawyers who brought the lawsuit.  Notifications Regarding Manriquez v. DeVos Lawsuit  Beginning Dec. 26 , 2019 , the U.S. Department of Education ED will email notifications about the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit to borrower defense applicants who are potential members of the group of borrowers to whom the lawsuit applies. The email notifications will be sent to borrowers from the email address noreply@studentaid.gov. For borrowers without a good email address , ED will mail notifications. The mailed notifications will be sent to borrowers in an envelope marked with Federal Student Aid s return address. Each borrower will receive either an emailed notification or a mailed notification. If you have questions about notifications you receive that aren t answered below , there s more information about the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit on Class Counsel s website at harvardlaw.github.io/ppsl_dropdown/index. You can contact the lawyers representing the covered class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit by emailing CMclass@law.harvard.edu or calling 617 - 390 - 2612. Q. I received an email from noreply@studentaid.gov saying that I may be part of a group of borrowers protected under a lawsuit called Manriquez v. DeVos. Is this email legitimate? Yes. You may be part of a group referred to as a class that is protected in certain ways because of a lawsuit called Manriquez v. DeVos. The U.S. Department of Education ED contacted you to make sure you know how to determine if you are part of the class , what protections you have , that ED made mistakes recently that may have applied to you , what ED has done to fix the mistakes , and where to find more information about the lawsuit and your federal student loans. ED contacted you because its records show that you borrowed one or more Direct Loans to attend or for your child to attend Heald College, Everest Institute, or WyoTech, operated by Corinthian Colleges, Inc. ED s records also show that you asked to cancel some or all of your federal student loan debt because the school you attended or that your child attended did something wrong. This is known as a borrower defense application. The intent of the email was to inform you generally about the lawsuit and give you contact information for obtaining additional information if needed. How do I find out if I m part of the group / class and get more information? To determine if you re a member of the class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit , visit the website set up by the class lawyers. You can contact the lawyers representing the covered class in the Manriquez v. DeVos lawsuit by emailing CMclass@law.harvard.edu or calling 617 - 390 - 2612. ED will still review and decide your borrower defense even if you are not a member of the class. What protections does the class get? A June 2018 court order in the lawsuit stops ED from collecting federal student loan payments from members of the class until the lawsuit is over. Since June 2018 , class members have not been required to make any payments on their loans related to Everest, Heald, or WyoTech. Loans that were not in default as of June 2018 should be placed into something called forbearance or another appropriate repayment status, such as an income - driven repayment plan that requires a payment of zero dollars or in - school deferment status. These statuses mean no payments are required , and your loans cannot go into default. Loans that were in default as of June 2018 should be placed in what is known as a stopped collections status. This status means ED must stop collecting money from you, such as by taking part of your paycheck or tax refund. What mistakes have been made? Many people in the class did not receive these protections. Specifically , since June 2018 , that work for ED mistakenly ED and companies sent bills to students and parents for money they were not required to pay , collected money from students and parents that they were not required to pay , reduced tax refunds or paychecks from students and parents , and made negative reports to credit reporting agencies. ED sincerely regrets these mistakes. What has ED done to fix its errors? A. ED has confirmed that potential class members are in the correct repayment status. ED is working with the Department of the Treasury to make sure that other payments that should not have been made, or that you would not have made otherwise, are given back. ED has also worked to fix any bad credit reporting that came from its mistakes. ED will work harder to make sure further mistakes do not happen. ED will review accounts of all potential people in the class to make sure there are no additional problems.

title : Regaining Eligibility | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  Have you been told you can t get federal student aid any longer?  In most circumstances , there are things you can do to get back your eligibility for financial aid. You might lose federal student aid eligibility for a number of reasons. For instance , you might no longer meet one of the basic eligibility criteria , or you might have changed majors and no longer be enrolled in a program that makes you eligible to receive a specific type of funding for instance, a Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education [TEACH] Grant. We recommend you talk to your financial aid office about those and any other circumstances that cause you to lose eligibility. Meanwhile , below we provide some tips on how to get your eligibility back if you find yourself in one of the following situations :  What if I defaulted on my student loan but now I want to get more federal student aid?  You ll need to get out of default before you can receive aid again.  What if my grades slipped, or I haven t completed enough credits, and my financial aid office told me I can t get federal student aid?  You need to make satisfactory academic progress in college or career school in order to keep getting federal student aid. Talk to your school about whether you can appeal the decision that made you ineligible to continue receiving federal student aid.  What if I was an eligible noncitizen but my status expired or was revoked?  You ll need to reinstate the status that made you an eligible noncitizen, or become a citizen or permanent resident, before you can receive federal student aid. For information about reinstating your status or becoming a citizen , contact U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  What if I was convicted of a drug offense but now I want to get more federal student aid?  If you ve lost eligibility due to a conviction for a drug offense , and you are not scheduled to regain eligibility this academic year , it is possible to regain eligibility early.  What if I m incarcerated?  Your incarceration affects your eligibility for different types of aid in different ways. If you are ineligible for a particular type of student aid due to your incarceration , you ll need to wait until you re released before you can get that type of aid.  What if I accidentally received more federal student loan or grant money than I was supposed to?  In certain cases , you ll need to repay the amount that was beyond the maximum that you were allowed to receive. You can either repay the excess all at once , or you can make arrangements to repay it a bit at a time. Once you ve repaid or made arrangements to repay the excess , you ll be able to receive additional federal student aid assuming you haven t reached the maximum amounts for all programs for which you are otherwise eligible. In other cases , your financial aid office might be able to adjust the amount of money you ll be getting from another federal student aid program to make up for the excess you received. If you have questions about repaying aid or getting additional aid , talk to the financial aid staff at your school.  What if I thought I had a high school diploma, but it turns out that I actually don t?  This situation might arise if, for instance, your high school is a diploma mill a school that charges a student a fee and requires him or her to complete little or no course work to get the diploma. If you don t have a high school diploma or an equivalent such as a General Educational Development GED certificate , you ll need to talk to the financial aid office at your school to find out what to do.  What if I was convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving fraud to obtain federal student aid funds?  You ll need to repay the funds to the U.S. Department of Education or in the case of a federal student loan to the holder or servicer of the loan.  What if I have property subject to a judgment lien?  If you have property subject to a judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States , you will have to pay your debt in full or make arrangements to pay the debt. 
title : Questions and Answers About FAFSA® Completion Data | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  Questions and Answers About FAFSA Completion Data  Below are questions we ve heard about the Completion by High School and Public School District">data we provide on FAFSA completion by high school.  Basics  Missing or Duplicate High Schools  Low Completion Totals  Technical and Analytical  Basics  What is the source of data?  The source of the data is the U.S. Department of Education's Central Processing System.  What years of Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) submission and completion data are available?  Federal Student Aid releases data for the current 2018 19 cycle and provides a side - by - side comparison of the previous 2017 18 cycle. We also have an archive that contains data files from the 2017 18 cycle comparing it to the past 2016 17 cycle. Each file has the previous cycle data through the same date in the prior year as well as the 6-month and 12-month numbers for the previous cycle. Only numbers of submitted and completed FAFSA forms are available. No personally identifiable information for any FAFSA filer will be shared through this process. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you see data that is inaccurate and/or you have suggestions for improvement. We welcome your input.  What is the difference between a submitted and a completed FAFSA form?  Submitted applications reflect all FAFSA forms submitted by students at that high school. These applications , however , can be subsequently rejected by the Central Processing System if they are missing key pieces of information. The applications that are not rejected are referred to as completed applications. Completed applications , therefore , are a subset of all submitted applications. If a FAFSA form is submitted but not complete , the student will receive an email from the Department of Education asking him or her to correct the FAFSA form. A completed FAFSA form is necessary to determine eligibility for federal student aid and often other forms of financial aid.  How often will the FAFSA submission data be updated?  From October through June , data releases are weekly. For the remainder of the calendar year , data releases occur every other Friday. (For high schools to track their progress, Federal Student Aid regularly updates estimates for the first 12 months of an application cycle. As of the 2017 18 FAFSA cycle, this is extended to the first 15 months of the application cycle and will cover October of one year through December of the following year.)  Missing or Duplicate High Schools  Why isn't my high school listed in these data files?  There are two primary reasons that you may not see your school on the list. Your school will not appear on the report if there are fewer than five completed applications. Your school may appear on the report , but it may be listed under an alternative name. Since school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. It is possible this name is different than your formal school name. As a result , it is important to look for other variations of your school name and city. You do not need to request to be added to the list. Once a high school shows at least five completed FAFSA forms , their submission and completion totals will appear in the database.  I cannot find my high school within the FAFSA form's high school search results. What could be causing this? How do I go about getting my school included?  With a few exceptions discussed below , most high schools should be contained in our database on the FAFSA form. If you can t find your school , double - check your spelling of the city and school name , and then try your search again. Also , consider alternate names or cities that may be used. Sometimes the official location of the school reported to us is a suburb within a larger city, or vice - versa. If after trying various possibilities you still cannot find your institution , you may still continue forward by clicking next. Despite being unable to find your school , the information you type in will still be captured and recorded, so be sure the spelling is correct. For public schools , our database should contain every high school in the nation, unless the school was opened, merged, or otherwise changed its name within the past year or two. If you fit into one of these categories , your school may not be listed within the current FAFSA form, but will be listed on future FAFSA forms. For private schools , our database contains every high school that has participated in the U.S. Department of Education's Private School Survey. Visit the National Center for Education Statistics if your private school would like more information. If your private school only recently participated in the survey , your school may not be listed within the current FAFSA form, but will be listed on future FAFSA forms.  Why do there appear to be duplicates of the same school?  Since these school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably. In aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants. However , when we are unable to determine if school name variations are referring to the same school , we err on the side of caution and do not aggregate the data to a single record and applicant count. In that instance , it may appear that there are duplicates of the same school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you believe your school has been listed more than once.  Low Completion Totals  Why is my number of FAFSA submissions or completions lower than I think it should be?  While we know that many high schools inadvertently overestimate their FAFSA completion rates , one reason your rates may be lower than expected is because your school could be listed more than once. This happens if students entered your school name in different ways on the FAFSA form. For instance , if some students listed " John Doe High School " and other students listed " Doe High School , " then your high school could be listed in more than one place. Please look for alternate names for your school. Email us at HSFAFSA@ed.gov if you find your school has been listed more than once.  I am a high school counselor or college access professional. What resources do you have to help increase FAFSA completion totals?  Federal Student Aid s Financial Aid Toolkit provides federal student aid information and outreach tools for counselors, college access professionals, nonprofit mentors, and others. The site helps counselors understand the basics of federal student aid, provides tips on hosting events along with sample PowerPoint presentations, provides suggested messages for social media and email outreach, and helps find other training opportunities.  I am a counselor at a high school with a lot of students age 20 or older. Why are my numbers so low?  Because there is no question on the FAFSA form that asks if an applicant is a high school senior , we must use several criteria to identify those applicants that are likely high school seniors. In this instance , the bulk of the students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date. Also , students must also be receiving their high school diploma, as opposed to a GED or other program, to fit this definition of a high school senior.  Technical and Analytical  The totals reported last year are different from the numbers reported now about last year. What is causing this?  There could be several causes for this, including the possibility that your institution is listed more than once in the data using alternate variations of the school's name or city. One other cause is a change we made in 2017 to our definition of a high school senior, which now aligns with other data we publicly release. In past years, we used proxies to determine whether an applicant was a first - time filer ; we now use true first - time filer status as one criterion for being a senior. While this impacts a relatively small number of applicants, if your total decreased compared to what we reported last year , then this may mean there were applicants that had applied in a previous year.  Can I add up all the submitted applications from a single state file to calculate a state total? What about adding up all the submitted applications from a single city?  The answer to both questions is no. The official location of a school or the location most commonly reported by students may actually be a suburb falling within a larger city's limits. For example , adding up all the applications reported under " New York City " would exclude any institutions reported being within " Queens " or even within " Jamaica, " a smaller neighborhood within the New York City Borough of Queens. Any analysis must also consider the impact of withholding the totals or names of schools with fewer than five completed applications. At its most basic level , summing the number of applications reported in these files always underestimates the number of applications. If an institution is reported as having " <5 " completed applications , one cannot assume there were zero applications. Further , the totals for some schools are never made public because their class sizes essentially preclude them from having enough completed applications to ever be disclosed publicly. Because this impacts some areas more than others , be sure to consider these and other factors when conducting any analyses.  Why do some districts appear in white on the maps?  Districts are listed as missing / insufficient data if any of the following conditions are true : The regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate is missing e.g., if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009 10. A district has fewer than 15 students in the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate data. There s an unpredicted increase in the number of district graduating seniors e.g., a dramatic increase in the graduation rate, or if two districts merge under one district's name. A district has fewer than 10 projected graduates. A district has fewer than five completed FAFSA forms. The National Center Education Statistics Local Education Agency LEA code does not match the LEA code found in the Tiger / Line shapefile for the state. 
title : Total and Permanent Disability Discharge | Federal Student Aid#1    Document :  If you re totally and permanently disabled, you may qualify for a discharge of your federal student loans and/or Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant service obligation.  A total and permanent disability TPD discharge relieves you from having to repay a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loan, a Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loan, and/or a Federal Perkins Loan or to complete a TEACH Grant service obligation. To qualify for a TPD discharge , you must complete and submit a TPD discharge application, along with documentation showing that you meet our requirements for being considered totally and permanently disabled, to Nelnet, the servicer that assists the U.S. Department of Education with the TPD discharge process. Note: Throughout this page , the words " we, " " our, " and " us " refer to the U.S. Department of Education.  How do I show that I qualify for a TPD discharge?

I received a TPD discharge but want to go back to school. Can I take out more student loans or TEACH Grants?  Yes , but with some conditions. If you received a TPD discharge based on VA documentation, SSA documentation, or a physician s certification , you must give your school a letter from a physician stating that you are once again able to engage in substantial gainful activity , and sign a statement acknowledging that you can't get a TPD discharge of the new loan or TEACH Grant based on a disabling condition that already exists when you receive the new loan or TEACH Grant, unless that condition substantially deteriorates in the future. If you received a TPD discharge based on SSA documentation or a physician s certification and your three - year postdischarge period hasn t ended , you must also resume repayment on your previously discharged loans or acknowledge that you are once again responsible for meeting the terms and conditions of your TEACH Grant service obligation.  If my loan is discharged due to TPD, do I have to pay taxes on the discharged loan amount?  Because of a change in federal law related to the taxability of loan amounts discharged due to TPD , the answer depends on when you received the discharge. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan before Jan. 1 , 2018 , the loan amount discharged may be considered income for federal tax purposes under Internal Revenue Service IRS rules. If you received a TPD discharge of a loan during the period from Jan. 1 , 2018 to Dec. 31 , 2025 , the discharged loan amount won t be considered income for federal tax purposes. For purposes of determining whether a loan amount discharged due to TPD may be treated as taxable income for federal tax purposes , the date you are considered to have received the discharge is different depending on how you qualified for the discharge. If you re a veteran who showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on a disability determination by the VA , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes on the date we approve the discharge. If you showed that you re totally and permanently disabled based on documentation from the SSA or a physician s certification meaning that you re subject to a three - year postdischarge monitoring period , you re considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes at the end of the postdischarge monitoring period. For example , if your discharge was approved in July 2017 , you would not be considered to have received the discharge for federal tax purposes until July 2020, at the end of the three - year postdischarge monitoring period. Therefore , the IRS would not consider the discharged loan amount to be taxable income for federal tax purposes. If you receive a Form 1099-C, you should keep the form for your records , but you do not need to include it when filing your federal tax return. For additional information , visit irs.gov. Loan amounts discharged due to TPD may still be considered income for state tax purposes. If you receive a TPD discharge of a federal student loan , you may want to consult with your state tax office or a tax professional before you file your state tax return.
