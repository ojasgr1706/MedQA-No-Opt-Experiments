So far, improvements in asthma  control following such measures have been difficult to  demonstrate. Many patients are sensitised to several  ubiquitous aeroallergens, making avoidance strategies  largely impractical. Measures to reduce fungal exposure  and eliminate cockroaches may be applicable in specific  circumstances, and medications known to precipitate or  aggravate asthma should be avoided.

Acute coryza is the most common URTI and is usually  the result of rhinovirus infection. In addition to general  malaise, acute coryza typically causes nasal discharge,  sneezing and cough.

Symptoms usually resolve quickly, but if  repeated URTIs \u2018go to the chest\u2019, a more formal diagno- sis of asthma ought to be considered. A variety of viruses  causing URTI may also trigger exacerbations of asthma  or COPD and aggravate other lung diseases. Bordetella pertussis , the cause of whooping cough, is  an important source of URTI. It is highly contagious and  is notifiable in the UK. Vaccination confers protection  and is usually offered in infancy, but its efficacy wanes  in adult life and the infection is easily spread. Adults  usually experience a mild illness similar to acute coryza,  but some individuals develop paroxysms of coughing  which can persist for weeks to months, earning whoop- ing cough the designation of \u2018the cough of 100 days\u2019.   The diagnosis may be confirmed by bacterial culture,  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a nasopharyngeal  swab or serological testing. If the illness is recognised  early in the clinical course, macrolide antibiotics may  ameliorate the course. Rhinosinusitis typically causes a combination of nasal  congestion, blockage or discharge, and may be accom- panied by facial pain/pressure or loss of smell. Exami- nation usually confirms erythematous swollen nasal  mucosa and pus may be evident. Nasal polyps should  be sought and dental infection excluded. Treatment with  topical corticosteroids, nasal decongestants and regular  nasal douching are usually sufficient and, although bac- terial infection is often present, antibiotics are only indi- cated if symptoms persist for more than 5 days. Persistent  symptoms or recurrent episodes should prompt a refer- ral to an ear, nose and throat specialist. Influenza is discussed on  page 319 ."}, {"<p>": "adults suffer from community-acquired pneumonia  (CAP) each year, accounting for around 5\u201312% of all  lower respiratory tract infections. It affects all age groups  but is particularly common at the extremes of age;  worldwide, CAP continues to kill more children than  any other illness, and its propensity to ease the passing  of the frail and elderly led to pneumonia being known  as the \u2018old man\u2019s friend\u2019. Most cases are spread by droplet infection and, whilst  CAP may occur in previously healthy individuals,  several factors may impair the effectiveness of local  defences and predispose to CAP ( Box 19.41 ).  Streptococ- cus pneumoniae  ( Fig. 19.32 ) remains the most common  infecting agent. The likelihood that other organisms may  be involved depends on the age of the patient and the  clinical context. Viral infections are important causes of  CAP in children, and their contribution to adult CAP is  increasingly recognised ( Box 19.42 ). A \u2018best guess\u2019 as to the likely organism may be made  from the context in which pneumonia develops, but not  from the clinical and radiological picture, which does  not differ sufficiently from one organism to another; the  term \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 has therefore been dropped.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae  is more common in young  people and rare in the elderly, whereas  Haemophilus  influenzae  is more common in the elderly, particularly  when underlying lung disease is present.  Legionella pneu- mophila  occurs in local outbreaks centred on contami- nated cooling towers in hotels, hospitals and other  industrial buildings.  Staphylococcus aureus  is more  common following an episode of influenza.

The inflammatory response in lobar pneumonia  evolves through stages of congestion, red then grey  hepatisation, and finally resolution. In the first stage, the  alveolar units are flooded by a proteinaceous exudate  and by neutrophils and red blood cells, and numerous  pneumococci may be observed. As fibrin forms on the  cut surface of the affected lobe, it resembles liver and   so this stage is known as \u2018red hepatisation\u2019.

Oxygen saturation  on air may be low, and the patient cyanosed and  distressed. Chest signs (p. 645) vary, depending on the phase of  the inflammatory response.

If the patient has received a course of recent  antibiotics, then piperacillin/tazobactam or a third- generation cephalosporin should be considered.

In general, they do not invade vital  structures but may cause symptoms by compressing the  trachea or the superior vena cava. A dermoid cyst may  very occasionally rupture into a bronchus. Malignant mediastinal tumours are distinguished by  their power to invade as well as compress surrounding  structures. As a result, even a small malignant tumour  can produce symptoms, although more commonly the  tumour has attained a considerable size before this  happens ( Box 19.76 ).

Therapy is ini- tiated with a high loading dose, followed by a mainte- nance dose based on the international normalised ratio  (INR).

Due to the narrow  therapeutic index of warfarin and its propensity to inter- act with other drugs and food, regular measurement   of the INR is required throughout the duration of   anticoagulation. Newer thrombin or activated factor X  inhibitors offer more predictable dosing and have   no requirement for coagulation monitoring; they may  ultimately replace warfarin. Decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation  represent a balance between the risk and consequences  of recurrence, and the risks of prolonged anticoagula- tion. In patients with an identifiable and reversible risk  factor, anticoagulation may be safely discontinued fol- lowing 3 months of therapy.

Inspiration results in negative pressure within  the pharynx. During wakefulness, upper airway dilating  muscles, including palatoglossus and genioglossus, con- tract actively during inspiration to preserve airway  patency. During sleep, muscle tone declines, impairing  the ability of these muscles to maintain pharyngeal  patency. In a minority of people, a combination of an  anatomically narrow palatopharynx and underactivity  of the dilating muscles during sleep results in inspira- tory airway obstruction. Incomplete obstruction causes  turbulent flow, resulting in snoring (around 40% of  middle-aged men and 20% of middle-aged women  snore). More severe obstruction triggers increased  inspiratory effort and transiently wakes the patient,  allowing the dilating muscles to re-open the airway.  These awakenings are so brief that patients have no  recollection of them. After a series of loud deep breaths  that may wake their bed partner, the patient rapidly  returns to sleep, snores and becomes apnoeic once more.  This cycle of apnoea and awakening may repeat itself  many hundreds of times per night and results in severe  sleep fragmentation and secondary variations in blood  pressure, which may predispose over time to cardiovas- cular disease. Predisposing factors to the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea  syndrome include male gender, which doubles the   risk, and obesity, which is found in about 50%,   because parapharyngeal fat deposits tend to narrow the  pharynx. Nasal obstruction or a recessed mandible can  further exacerbate the problem. Acromegaly and hypo- thyroidism also predispose by causing submucosal infil- tration and narrowing of the upper airway. Sleep apnoea  is often familial, where the maxilla and mandible are  back-set, narrowing the upper airway. Alcohol and  seda tives predispose to snoring and apnoea by relaxing  the upper airway dilating muscles. As a result of marked  sympathetic activation during apnoea, sleep-disordered  breathing is associated over time with sustained hyper- tension and an increased risk of coronary events and  stroke. An association has also been described with  insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and type II  diabetes.
