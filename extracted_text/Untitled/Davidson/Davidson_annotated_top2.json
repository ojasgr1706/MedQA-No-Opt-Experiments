[{"<p>": "Respiratory disease is responsible for a major burden of  morbidity and untimely death, with conditions such as  tuberculosis, pandemic influenza and pneumonia the  most important in world health terms. The increasing  prevalence of allergy, asthma and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD) contributes to the overall  burden of chronic disease in the community. By 2025,  the number of cigarette smokers worldwide is antici- pated to increase to 1.5 billion, ensuring a growing  burden of tobacco-related respiratory conditions. Respiratory disease covers a breadth of pathologies,  including infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic and  degenerative processes. The practice of respiratory  medi cine thus requires collaboration with a range of  disciplines. Recent advances have improved the lives of  many patients with obstructive lung disease, cystic  fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnoea and pulmonary hyper- tension, but the outlook remains poor for lung and other  respiratory cancers, and for some of the fibrosing lung  conditions."}, {"<p>": "The lungs occupy the upper two-thirds of the bony  thorax, bounded medially by the spine, the heart and the  mediastinum and inferiorly by the diaphragm.

Inspiration involves  downward contraction of the dome-shaped diaphragm  (innervated by the phrenic nerves originating from C3,  4 and 5) and upward, outward movement of the ribs   on the costovertebral joints, caused by contraction of   the external intercostal muscles (innervated by intercos- tal nerves originating from the thoracic spinal cord).  Expiration is largely passive, driven by elastic recoil   of the lungs. The conducting airways from the nose to the alveoli  connect the external environment with the extensive,  thin and vulnerable alveolar surface. As air is inhaled  through the upper airways, it is filtered in the nose,  heated to body temperature and fully saturated with  water vapour; partial recovery of this heat and moisture  occurs on expiration. Total airway cross-section is small- est in the glottis and trachea, making the central airway  particularly vulnerable to obstruction by foreign bodies  and tumours. Normal breath sounds originate mainly  from the rapid turbulent airflow in the larynx, trachea  and main bronchi. The multitude of small airways within the lung  parenchyma has a very large combined cross-sectional  area (over 300 cm  in the third-generation respiratory  bronchioles), resulting in very slow flow rates. Airflow  is normally silent here, and gas transport occurs largely  by diffusion in the final generations. Major bronchial  and pulmonary divisions are shown in  Figure 19.1 .

Elastin fibres  in alveolar walls maintain small airway patency by  radial traction on the airway walls.

The volume that can be exhaled is thus limited  purely by the capacity of the expiratory muscles to  distort the chest wall inwards. In emphysema, loss of  alveolar walls leaves the small airways unsupported,  and their collapse on expiration causes air trapping and  high end-expiratory volume (p. 673).

The char- acteristics of cough originating at various levels of the  respiratory tract are detailed in  Box 19.5 . The explosive quality of a normal cough is lost in  patients with respiratory muscle paralysis or vocal cord  palsy. Paralysis of a single vocal cord gives rise to   a prolonged, low-pitched, inefficient \u2018bovine\u2019 cough  accompanied by hoarseness. Coexistence of an inspira- tory noise (stridor) indicates partial obstruction of a  major airway (e.g. laryngeal oedema, tracheal tumour,  scarring, compression or inhaled foreign body) and  requires urgent investigation and treatment.

In this  context, it is most often explained by cough-variant  asthma (where cough may be the principal or exclusive  clinical manifestation), post-nasal drip secondary to  nasal or sinus disease, or gastro-oesophageal reflux with  aspiration. Diagnosis of the latter may require ambula- tory oesophageal pH monitoring or a prolonged trial of  anti-reflux therapy ( p. 865 ). Between 10% and 15% of  patients (particularly women) taking angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors develop a drug- induced chronic cough.  Bordetella pertussis  infection in  adults (p. 682) can also result in protracted cough and  should be suspected in those in close contact with chil- dren.

Orthopnoea, however, is common in COPD, as well  as in heart disease, because airflow obstruction is made  worse by cranial displacement of the diaphragm by the  abdominal contents when recumbent, so many patients  choose to sleep propped up.

In type I respiratory failure, high con- centrations of oxygen (40\u201360% by mask) will usually  relieve hypoxia by increasing the alveolar  P O  in poorly  ventilated lung units. Occasionally, however (e.g. severe  pneumonia affecting several lobes), mechanical ventila- tion may be needed to relieve hypoxia. Patients who  need high concentrations of oxygen for more than a few  hours should receive humidified oxygen. Acute type II respiratory failure is an emergency  requiring immediate intervention. It is useful to distin- guish between patients with high ventilatory drive  (rapid respiratory rate and accessory muscle recruit- ment) who cannot move sufficient air, and those with  reduced or inadequate respiratory effort. In the former,  particularly if inspiratory stridor is present, acute upper  airway obstruction from foreign body inhalation or  laryngeal obstruction (angioedema, carcinoma or vocal  cord paralysis) must be considered, as the Heimlich  man\u0153uvre (p. 728), immediate intubation or emergency  tracheostomy may be life-saving. More commonly, the problem is in the lungs, with  severe generalised bronchial obstruction from COPD   or asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)  arising from a variety of insults ( p. 191 ), or occasionally  tension pneumothorax (p. 728).

Moreover, in contrast to acute severe  asthma, some patients with \u2018acute on chronic\u2019 type II  respiratory failure due to COPD may not be distressed,  despite being critically ill with severe hypoxaemia,  hypercapnia and acidaemia.

Measures to reduce fungal exposure  and eliminate cockroaches may be applicable in specific  circumstances, and medications known to precipitate or  aggravate asthma should be avoided.

It affects all age groups  but is particularly common at the extremes of age;  worldwide, CAP continues to kill more children than  any other illness, and its propensity to ease the passing  of the frail and elderly led to pneumonia being known  as the \u2018old man\u2019s friend\u2019.

Viral infections are important causes of  CAP in children, and their contribution to adult CAP is  increasingly recognised ( Box 19.42 ). A \u2018best guess\u2019 as to the likely organism may be made  from the context in which pneumonia develops, but not  from the clinical and radiological picture, which does  not differ sufficiently from one organism to another; the  term \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 has therefore been dropped.

The factors predisposing to the  development of pneumonia in a hospitalised patient   are listed in  Box 19.48 . The organisms implicated in  early-onset HAP (occurring within 4\u20135 days of   admission) are similar to those involved in CAP. Late- onset HAP is associated with a different range of patho- gens to CAP, with more Gram-negative bacteria (e.g.  Escherichia ,  Pseudomonas ,  Klebsiella  species and  Acineto- bacter baumannii ),  Staph. aureus  (including the meticillin- resistant type (MRSA)) and anaerobes."}, {"<p>": "The principles of management are similar to those for  CAP, focusing on adequate oxygenation, appropriate  fluid balance and antibiotics.

If the patient has received a course of recent  antibiotics, then piperacillin/tazobactam or a third- generation cephalosporin should be considered. In late-onset HAP, the choice of antibiotics must  cover the Gram-negative bacteria (see above),  Staph.  aureus (including  MRSA)  and  anaerobes.  Anti- pseudomonal cover may be provided by a carbapenem  (meropenem) or a third-generation cephalosporin com- bined with an aminoglycoside.

A. baumannii  is usually sensitive to carbapenems  but resistant cases may require the prolonged adminis- tration of nebulised colistin. The choice of agents is most  appropriately guided by knowledge of local patterns of  microbiology and antibiotic resistance. It is usual to  commence broad-based cover, discontinuing less appro- priate antibiotics as culture results become available.

Suppurative pneumonia and pulmonary abscess  often develop after the inhalation of septic material  during operations on the nose, mouth or throat under  general anaesthesia, or of vomitus during anaesthesia or  coma, particularly if oral hygiene is poor. Additional  risk factors for aspiration pneumonia include bulbar or  vocal cord palsy, stroke, achalasia or oesophageal reflux,  and alcoholism. Aspiration tends to localise to depend- ent areas of the lung, such as the apical segment of the  lower lobe in a supine patient. Suppurative pneumonia  and pulmonary abscess may also complicate local bron- chial obstruction from a neoplasm or foreign body.

The ECG is often normal but is useful in excluding  other important differential diagnoses, such as acute  myocardial infarction and pericarditis. The most  common findings in PE include sinus tachycardia and  anterior T-wave inversion but these are non-specific;  larger emboli may cause right heart strain revealed by  an S Q T  pattern, ST-segment and T-wave changes, or  the appearance of right bundle branch block. Arterial blood gases typically show a reduced  Pa O and a normal or low  Pa CO , and an increased alveolar\u2013 arterial oxygen gradient, but may be normal in a signifi- cant minority. A metabolic acidosis may be seen in acute  massive PE with cardiovascular collapse. D-dimer is a specific degradation product released  into the circulation when cross-linked fibrin undergoes  endogenous fibrinolysis ( p. 1000 ). An elevated D-dimer  is of limited value, as it may be raised in a variety of  conditions including PE, myocardial infarction, pneu- monia and sepsis. However, low levels ( <  500 ng/mL,  measured by ELISA), particularly where clinical risk is  low, have a high negative predictive value and further  investigation is usually unnecessary ( Fig. 19.68 ).

Therapy is ini- tiated with a high loading dose, followed by a mainte- nance dose based on the international normalised ratio  (INR).

Due to the narrow  therapeutic index of warfarin and its propensity to inter- act with other drugs and food, regular measurement   of the INR is required throughout the duration of   anticoagulation. Newer thrombin or activated factor X  inhibitors offer more predictable dosing and have   no requirement for coagulation monitoring; they may  ultimately replace warfarin. Decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation  represent a balance between the risk and consequences  of recurrence, and the risks of prolonged anticoagula- tion. In patients with an identifiable and reversible risk  factor, anticoagulation may be safely discontinued fol- lowing 3 months of therapy. Those with persistent pro- thrombotic risks or a history of previous emboli should  be anticoagulated for life. In patients with cancer- associated VTE, LMWH should be continued for at   least 6 months before switching to warfarin. For patients  with unprovoked VTE, the appropriate duration of   anticoagulation should be at least 3 months, but pro- longed therapy should be considered in males (who  have a higher risk of recurrent VTE than females), those  in whom the D-dimer remains elevated when measured  1 month after stopping anticoagulation, those with post- thrombotic syndrome, and those in whom recurrent   PE may be fatal.

Predisposing factors to the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea  syndrome include male gender, which doubles the   risk, and obesity, which is found in about 50%,   because parapharyngeal fat deposits tend to narrow the  pharynx. Nasal obstruction or a recessed mandible can  further exacerbate the problem. Acromegaly and hypo- thyroidism also predispose by causing submucosal infil- tration and narrowing of the upper airway. Sleep apnoea  is often familial, where the maxilla and mandible are  back-set, narrowing the upper airway. Alcohol and  seda tives predispose to snoring and apnoea by relaxing  the upper airway dilating muscles. As a result of marked  sympathetic activation during apnoea, sleep-disordered  breathing is associated over time with sustained hyper- tension and an increased risk of coronary events and  stroke. An association has also been described with  insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and type II  diabetes. Treatment of sleep apnoea reduces sympa- thetic drive and blood pressure, and may also improve  these associated metabolic disorders."}, {"<s1>": "Sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome: overnight oxygen  saturation trace."}, {"<p>": "and snoring is virtually universal.
