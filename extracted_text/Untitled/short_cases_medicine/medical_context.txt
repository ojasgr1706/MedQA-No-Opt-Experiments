Proceed as follows:
· Listen to the chest for wheeze (bronchial carcinoid).
· Listen to the heart (right-sided murmurs in intestinal, gastric, hepatic and ovarian
carcinoid, left-sided murmurs in bronchial carcinoid).
· Look for hepatomegaly (nodular and firm due to metastases, may be pulsatile due
to tricuspid regurgitation).
DIAGNOSIS
This patient has facial flushing and tricuspid regurgitation (lesion) due to carcinoid syndrome (aetiology) and is in cardiac failure (functional status).
||
INSTRUCTION
Look at this patient.
SALIENT FEATURES
History
· Cancer of gallbladder and biliary system (obese women have a higher incidence). · Cancer of colon, rectum and prostate, and renal cell cancer (N Engl J Med 2000;
343:1305-11) (higher in obese men).
Examination
Patient has excessive adipose tissue.
Family history of obesity (parental obesity more than doubles the risk of adult obesity among both obese and non-obese children under 10 years of age, N Engl J Med 1997; 337: 869-73).
History of sleep apnoea, snoring and insomnia.
History of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease. Gastro-oesophageal reflux.
History of gallstones (cholesterol gallstones more prevalent in obesity). History of endometrial cancer in women (two to three times more common in
obese than in lean women).
History of breast cancer (risk increases with body mass index in postmenopausal
· women).
Proceed as follows:
· Measure the height and body weight (to determine body mass index).
Check blood pressure (the prevalence of hypertension is approximately three times higher in the obese than the non-obese).
Examine the joints to exclude osteoarthrosis.
Examine skin for intertrigo in redundant folds of skin (fungal and yeast infections of skin are also common).
· Tell the examiner that you would like to:
-Assess urine sugar (the prevalence of diabetes is three times higher in over- weight than in non-overweight persons).
-Check serum lipids (these patients otlen have an adverse pattern of plasma lipoproteins that generally improves with weight loss).
-Assess pulmonary function (sleep apnoea).
-Exclude secondary causes (hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome).
DIAGNOSIS
This patient has gross obesity (lesion) of genetic origin, complicated by hyper-tension and osteoarthrosis.

INSTRUCTION
Examine this patient. Look at this patient's face.
SALIENT FEATURES
History
· History of steroid therapy.
· Central weight gain.
· Hirsutism (see pp 428-31).
· Easy braising.
· Acne.
· Weakness of muscle.
· Menstrual disturbance.
· Loss of libido.
· Depression, sleep disturbances.
· Back pain due to spinal osteoporosis.
Examination
Moon-like facies (Fig. 3), acne, hirsutism and plethora (due to telangiectasia).
Proceed as follows:
· Examine the following:
-The mouth for superimposed thrush.
-The interscapular area for 'buffalo hump'.
-Increased fat pads and bulge above supraclavicular fossae (more specific for Cushing's syndrome).
-The abdomen for thinning of skin and purple striae (also seen over the shoulders and thighs) - said to be present on almost all patients (Fig. 4).
-The limbs for bruising, wasting of the limbs, weakness of the muscles of the
shoulders and hips - get the patient to squat (proximal myopathy).
-Ask the patient whether she has back pain and then examine the spine, looking for
evidence of osteoporosis and collapse of vertebra, kyphoscoliosis. -Measure the blood pressure. · Tell the examiner you would like to: -Test the urine for glucose.
-Check visual fields (for pituitary tumour).
-Examine the fundus for optic atrophy, papilloedema, signs of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy.
Note. Hirsutism is not common in Cushing's syndrome caused by exogenous steroids because they suppress adrenal androgen secretion.
Also comment on signs of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, fibrosing alveolitis (as these are conditions that are treated with long-term steroids).
DIAGNOSIS
This patient has moon-like facies, acne and supraclavicular pads of fat (lesions), which are features of Cushing's syndrome caused by long-term steroid therapy (aetiology) for asthma. The patient is now steroid dependent and is disabled by proximal myopathy and kyphoscoliosis due to osteoporosis (functional status).
