            "ques": "How would you differentiate between an exudate and a transudate?\n",
            "ans": "\u00b7       The protein content of an exudate is more than 3 g/l. However, if this criterion alone is applied, about 10% of the exudates and15% of the transudates will be wrongly classified. A more accurate diagnosis is made when Light's criteria (Ann Intern Med1972; 77: 507-13) for an exudate are applied: (1) the ratio of the pleural fluid to serum protein is greater than 0.5; (2) the ratio ofpleural fluid to serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is greater than 0.6; (3) pleural fluid LDH is greater than two thirds the uppernormal limit for blood LDH levels. Roth et al (1990) found that, althomzh Light's criteria had a sensitivity of 100%, they had alow specificity of 72% (Chest 1990; 98: 546-9). This was due to the fact that many patients with effusion due to chronic cardiacfailure have protein values inthe exudate range, particularly when on chronic diuretic therapy. They found that the serum-effusion albumin gradient (i.e. serumalbumin minus pleural fluid albumin) was 95% sensitive but a more specific (100%) marker of exudative effusion. A gradient of lessthan 1.2 g/dl indicates an exudative effusion whereas a gradient greater than 1.2 g/dl indicates a transudative effusion.\u00b7       The pleural fluid cholesterol level is below 60 mg/dl in transudates. All malignant effusions have a pleural cholesterol levelgreater than this value, and therefore this test is useful to separate these two categories of effusion (Chest 1987; 92: 296-302;Chest1991; 99: 1097-102).\n"

Pleural involvement is associated with male sex, rheumatoid factor in serum, the presence ofnodules and other systemic manifestations. The effusion is thought to develop as an inflammatory response to the presence ofmultiple subpleural nodules. For reasons that are entirely unclear, the left side is the more common site of unilateral rheumatoidpleural effusions. The pleural fluid glucose level is characteristically low and is said to be due to an 'entrance block' in which glucoseis unable to enter the pleural space, unlike in empyema and malignant effusions where the low pleural fluid glucose concentration isattributed to the increased use of glucose by cells. Cytological appearances of slender and elongated macrophages, round giantmultinucleated macrophages, presence of very few mesothelial cells and necrotic background material are thought to bepathognomonic of rheumatoid pleuritis.\n"

Neutrophils and macrophages then release proteases that break down connective tissue in the lung parenchyma, resulting in emphysema, and also stimulate hypersecretion of bronchial mucus. The chronic inflammatory process in COPD differs markedly from that seen in bronchial asthma, with different inflam-matory cells, mediators, inflammatory effects and responses to treatment (Thorax 1998: 53:129 36; Chest 2000; 117 (suppl): 10S-14S).\n"

            "ans": "ott-antitrypsin deficiency \u00b7 It was first described in Sweden. The patient is deficient in alpha-antitrypsin, with activity approximately 15% that of the normal value; concentrations of 40% or more are required for health. The patient is homozygous for the protease inhibitor (Pi) ZZ gene. Other genetic combinations and their percentage normal activity are PiMS (80%), PiMZ (60%), PiSS (60%), PiSZ (40%). Six per cent of the population is heterozygous for S(PiMS) and 4% for Z(PiMZ), making an overall frequency of 1 in 10 for the carriage of the defective gene. Liver transplantation results in conversion to the genotype of the donor. \u00b7 In the lung, alpha1-antitrypsin inhibits the excessive actions of neutrophil and macro-phage elastase, which cigarette smoke promotes. When the lung is heavily exposed to cigarette smoke, the protective effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin may be over-whelmed by the amount of elastase released or hy a direct oxidative action of cigarette smoke on the alpha 1 -antitrypsin molecule. The emphysema is panacinar and is seen in the lower lobes of the lungs. Smoking increases the severity and decreases the age of onset of emphysema. Liver disease is a much less common complication. Human alpha 1 -antltrypsm prepared from pooled plasma from normal donors is recommended for patients over 18 years with serum levels below 11 gmol/l and abnormal lung function. \u00b7 The siblings of an index case should be screened for this disorder. Their identifi-cation should be followed by counselling to avoid smoking and occupations with atmospheric pollution. Children of homozygotes will inherit at least one Z gene and hence will be heterozygotes. They should avoid pairing with another heterozygote if they wish to avoid the risk of producing an affected homozygote. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) COAD is 10 times more common in Taiwanese with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for TNF-alpha resulting in increased production of TNF-alpha (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1997; 156:136-9). However, the same polymorphism in the UK population is not associated with increased risk of COAD (Eur Respir J 2000; 15: 2814). Microsomal epoxide hydrolase A polymorphism variant of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of epoxides that may be generated in tobacco smoke, has been associated with a quintupling of the risk of COAD (Lancet1997; 350: 663). \n"

            "ans": "\u00b7 Bullectomy may improve gas exchange and airflow, and reduce dyspnoea in selected patients with bu]lae larger than one third of the hemithorax and accom-panying lung compression. \u00b7 Lung-volume reduction surgery (N Engl J Med 2000; 343: 239-45) results in functional improvements including increased FEV1, reduced total lung capacity, improved function of respiratory muscles, improved exercise capacity and improved quality of life (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 112: 1319-29; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1999; 160: 2018-27). These benefits persist for at least a year but the long-term benefits are not known and are currently being investigated by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Group (Chest 1999; 116: 1750-61). \u00b7 Single lung transplantation: this has been successful for at least 34 years in patients with COAD.

All three types can be present in the same patient. \u00b7 Cylindrical bronchiectasis: refers to bronchi that are uniformly dilated and do not taper, but rather end abruptly. This is due to plugging of smaller bronchi by thick mucus and casts. The bronchi are dilated to greater than 2 mm but can be so large as to admit a finger. \u00b7 Varicose bronchiectasis: refers to dilated bronchi with irregular bulging contours similar to a varicose vein. They do not taper and terminations are bulbous. Bronchial subdivisions are reduced. \u00b7 Cystic or saccular bronchiectasis: the most severe form, characterized by sharply reduced bronchial subdivisions and dilated bronchi ending in cystic pus-filled cavities.\n"

The tissue has no communication with thebronchopulmonary tree. Two types of sequestration have been described: extralobar and intralobar. An extralobar sequestration hasits own pleural lining, which separates it from the remaining lung tissue, and the intralobar type shares its pleura with the adjacentnormal lung. Patients usually present in childhood with cough and recurrent pneumonia, and occasionally present with haemoptysis.\n"

On the long arm of chromosome 7 resides the gene coding for a 1480-amino-acid protein a cyclicAMP-regulated chloride channel, now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR). The CFTR gene iscarried by I in 20 Caucasians and its incidence is about 1 in 2000 live births. There is a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 7in 70% of patients. There is a deletion of the codon for phenylalanine at position 508 (A508; N Engl J Med 1990; 323:1517). Thisdetect leads to a failure of the chloride channel to open in response to cyclic AMP (Science 1992; 256: 774-9: N Engl d Med 1991;325: 575-7). More than 175 other types of lesion in the cystic fibrosis gene are responsible for the disease in the remaining 30% ofpatients.\n"

In patients with cystic fibrosisthere is a defect in these channels which prevents the normal secretion of chloride into the airway lumen. Simultaneously, there is athree-fold increase in the reabsorp-tion of sodium from the airway lumen into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. As the movement ofwater into airway secretions follows the movement of salt, it is believed that a decreased secretion of chloride into the airway lumenand the increased reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen combine to reduce water content and increase the viscosity andtenacity of the airway secretions.\n"

            "ans": "\u00b7       CXR typically shows bilateral basal reticulonodular shadows which advance upwards as the disease progresses. In advancedcases there is marked destruction of the parenchyma causing 'honeycombing' (due to groups of closely set ring shadows), andnodular shadows are not conspicuous. The mediastinum may appear broad as a result of a decrease in lung volume.\u00b7       Blood gases: arterial desaturation worsens while upright and improves on recum-bency. There is arterial hypoxaemia and hypocapnia.\u00b7       Pulmonary function tests: in the early stages lung volumes may be normal, but there is arterial desaturation following exercise.Typically there is a restrictive defect with reduction of both the gas transfer factor and gas transfer coefficient.\u00b7       High ESR; raised immunoglobulins; raised antinuclear factor; rheumatoid factoris positive.\u00b7       Bronchial lavage: a large number of lymphocytes indicates a good response to steroids and a good prognosis. A large numberof neutrophils and eosinophils indi-cates a poor prognosis (5-year survival rate of 60% for steroid responders versus 25% fornon-responders). The patients are more likely to respond to cyclophos-phamide if the number of neutrophils is increased (AmRev Respir Dis 1987; 135: 26).\u00b7       Lung biopsy: in early stages there is mononuclear cell infiltration in the alveolar walls, progressing to interstitial fibrosis - knownas usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP); in later stages fibrotic contraction of the lung, honeycombing, bronchial dilatation andcysts are seen. DIP - alveolar macrophages with little mononuclear infiltration or fibrosis - has a better prognosis than UIP as itresponds to steroids.\u00b7       MRI is useful in determining disease activity without ionizing radiation but it isan expensive method. \u00b7 High-resolution CT (HRCT) is useful to assess the pattern and extent of disease. Patients with a predominantly ground-glassappearance are treated whereas those with a predominantly reticular appearance undergo technetium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate scanning (DPTA) to assess the probability of deterioration. HRCT may avoid the need for biopsy, especially ifthere is predominantly reticular shadowing. It acts as a guide for ideal biopsy site.\u00b7       Technetium-99m diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DPTA) scanning in non-smokers is of value in identifying which patients aremore likely to deteriorate. Therapy can be postponed when there is slow clearance, whereas those with fast clearance shouldreceive treatment (Eur Respir J 1993; 6: 797-802).\n"

            "ans": "MRI of the thorax is less useful than CT scanning because of poorer imaging of the pulmonary parenchyma and inferior spatial resolution. However, MRI can provide images in multiple planes (e.g. sagittal, coronal as well as transverse) which CT can not. MRI is excellent for evaluating processes near the lung apex, spine and thoraco-abdominal junction.\n"

Thetube should be left in for at least 24 hours. When the lung re-expands, clamp the tube for 24 hours. If repeat radio-graphyshows that the lung remains expanded, the tube can be removed. If not, suction should be applied to the tube. If it fails toresolve within I week, surgical pleurodesis should be considered.

            "ans": "Serum TSH measurement is the single most reliable test to diagnose all commonforms of hyperthyroidism, particularly in an outpatient setting (Arch Intern Meal2000; 160: 1573-5). Typically, serum concentrations are less than 0.1 mIU/l inGraves' disease, toxic adenoma, nodular goitre, subacute and lymphocytic (silent,postpartum) thyroiditis, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism and exogenous thyroidhormone excess. To diagnose hyperthyroidism accurately, TSH assay sensitivity,the lowest reliably measured TSH concentration, must be 0.02 mlU/l or less. Someless sensitive TSH assays cannot reliably distinguish hyperthyroidism fromeuthyroidism. Free T4 and T3 concentrations should be measured when lesssensitive TSH assays are utilized. In rare types of TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism(pituitary adenomas and selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone) serumTSH alone will not suffice and again free T4 and T3 concentrations should be measured.\n"

There are two mechanisms by which amiodarone may cause hyperthyroidism: thyroid destruction due to an iodine-associated increase in circulating interleukin-6 (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1994; 78: 423-7) or an increase in thyroid hormone synthesis. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism sometimes responds to thionamide antithyroid drugs but may also be very resistant to treatment.

Radioiodine may be used in patients withmild eye disease but adjuvant oral corticosteriods should be prescribed (N Engl JMed 1998; 338: 73-8).\u00b7    Secondly, patients without clinical evidence of thyroid disease have a small risk ofdeveloping ophthalmopathy and a very low risk of developing severe eye disease.It is prudent to warn all patients of this complication, but the risks do not justifydenying most patients the benefits of definitive treatment with radioiodine whenindicated. In addition, the risks do not justify the routine use of corti-costeroids inpatients without ophthalmopathy (BMJ 1999; 319: 68-9).\u00b7    Thirdly, smoking, a raised serum triiodothyronine concentration, and uncorrectedhypothyroidism are also factors which can exacerbate thyroid eye disease.There-fore, to reduce the risk of thyroid eye disease, patients should beencouraged to stop smoking, be rendered euthyroid with a thionamide beforeradioiodine, and be monitored closely to detect and treat early hypothyroidism orpersistent hyperthyroidism.\n"

On recovery from the illness, the indices of thyroid function return to normal (N Engl J Med 1995; 333: 1562-3). The changes in thyroidal indices include: \u00b7 Decrease in extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine T4 to triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of the thyroid hormone. A decrease in thyrotrophin secretion, which causes decreased thyroidal secretion and, in time, decreases in serum T4 concentrations and further decreases in serum T3 concentrations - the latter due to both decreased secretion of T3 by the thyroid and diminished availability of T4 for peripheral conversion to T3. Decreased production or diminished affinity for thyroidal hormones of one or more major serum thyroid hormone-binding proteins - thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin and albumin. These decreases can result in decreased serum total thyroxine levels but not in free T4 or T3. Serum concentrations of reverse T3 (which is inactive) are increased because its deiodination is impaired. \n"

Proceed as follows: \u00b7 Examine the following: -The mouth for superimposed thrush. -The interscapular area for 'buffalo hump'. -Increased fat pads and bulge above supraclavicular fossae (more specific for Cushing's syndrome). -The abdomen for thinning of skin and purple striae (also seen over the shoulders and thighs) - said to be present on almost all patients (Fig. 4). -The limbs for bruising, wasting of the limbs, weakness of the muscles of the shoulders and hips - get the patient to squat (proximal myopathy). -Ask the patient whether she has back pain and then examine the spine, looking for evidence of osteoporosis and collapse of vertebra, kyphoscoliosis. -Measure the blood pressure. \u00b7 Tell the examiner you would like to: -Test the urine for glucose. -Check visual fields (for pituitary tumour). -Examine the fundus for optic atrophy, papilloedema, signs of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy. Note. Hirsutism is not common in Cushing's syndrome caused by exogenous steroids because they suppress adrenal androgen secretion. Also comment on signs of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, fibrosing alveolitis (as these are conditions that are treated with long-term steroids). DIAGNOSIS This patient has moon-like facies, acne and supraclavicular pads of fat (lesions), which are features of Cushing's syndrome caused by long-term steroid therapy (aetiology) for asthma. The patient is now steroid dependent and is disabled by proximal myopathy and kyphoscoliosis due to osteoporosis (functional status).                ",
