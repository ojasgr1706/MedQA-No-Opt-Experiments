Accordingly, the mass of the respiratory muscles is part of the chest wall, while the force these muscles generate is part of the neuromuscular system; the abdomen (especially an obese abdomen) and the heart (especially an enlarged heart) are, for these purposes, part of the chest wall. Each of these three components has mechanical properties that relate to its enclosed volume (or—in the case of the neuromuscular system—the respiratory system volume at which it is operating) and to the rate of change of its volume (i.e., flow). The work of breathing required of the neuromuscular system is the sum of the work due to volume-related mechanical properties and the work from flow-related mechanical properties required to move air throughout the airways to create this volume change. Volume-Related Mechanical Properties—Statics Figure 285-1 shows the volume-related properties of each component of the respiratory system. Because of both surface tension at the air-liquid interface between alveolar wall lining fluid and alveolar gas and elastic recoil of the lung tissue itself, the lung requires a positive transmural pressure difference between alveolar gas and its pleural surface to stay inflated; this difference is called the elastic recoil
