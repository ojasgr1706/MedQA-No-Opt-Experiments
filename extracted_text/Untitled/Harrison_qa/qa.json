The A-a O2 difference on room air should be less than 15 mmHg in a young adult\nand typically increases slightly with age. The A-a O2 difference cannot easily be interpreted\nwhen the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is greater than 0.21. The A-a O2 difference on room\nair is elevated in situations of hypoxemia due to ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, shunt, or\ndiffusion defect. It will be normal when the hypoxemia is solely due to hypoventilation. In this\ncase, the gradient is 7.5 mmHg, consistent with hypoventilation secondary to a presumed\nnarcotic overdose. Asthma and pulmonary embolism typically cause hypoxemia due to V/Q\nmismatch. Pneumococcal and pneumocystis pneumonias cause hypoxemia for multifactorial\nreasons, including shunt."

        "explanation": "Ventilatory\nfunction can be easily measured with lung volume measurement and the FEV1/FVC ratio. A\ndecreased FEV1/FVC ratio is characteristic of obstructive lung diseases. Alternatively, low lung\nvolumes, specifically decreased total lung capacity (TLC), and occasionally decreased residual\nvolume (RV) are characteristic of restrictive lung diseases. With extensive air trapping in\nobstructive lung disease, TLC is often increased, and RV may also be increased. Vital capacity\n(VC) is proportionally decreased. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measures respiratory\nmuscle strength and is decreased in patients with neuromuscular disease. Thus, myasthenia\ngravis will produce low lung volumes and decreased MIP, whereas patients with idiopathic\npulmonary fibrosis will have normal muscle strength and subsequently a normal MIP but\ndecreased TLC and RV. In some cases of pulmonary parenchymal restrictive lung disease, the\nincrease in elastic recoil results in an increased FEV1/FVC ratio. The hallmark of obstructive\nlung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a decreased FEV1/FVC\nratio."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In this patient presenting with multilobar pneumonia,\nhypoxemia is present that does not correct with increasing the concentration of inspired oxygen.\nThe inability to overcome hypoxemia or the lack of a notable increase in partial pressure of\narterial oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen saturation (SaO2) with increasing fraction of inspired oxygen\nphysiologically defines a shunt. A shunt occurs when deoxygenated blood is transported to the\nleft heart and systemic circulation without having the capability of becoming oxygenated. Causes\nof shunt include alveolar collapse (atelectasis), intra-alveolar filling processes, intrapulmonary\nvascular malformations, or structural cardiac disease leading to right-to-left shunt. In this case,\nthe patient has multilobar pneumonia leading to alveoli that are being perfused but unable to\nparticipate in gas exchange because they are filled with pus and inflammatory exudates. Acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome is another common cause of shunt physiology. V/Q mismatch is\nthe most common cause of hypoxemia and results when there are some alveolar units with low\nratios (low ventilation to perfusion) that fail to fully oxygenate perfused blood. When blood is\nreturned to the left heart, the poorly oxygenated blood admixes with blood from normal alveolar\nunits. The resultant hypoxemia is less severe than with shunt and can be corrected with\nincreasing the inspired oxygen concentration. Hypoventilation with or without other causes of\nhypoxemia is not present in this case, as the PCO2 <40 mmHg indicates hyperventilation. The\nacidosis present in this case is of a metabolic rather than a pulmonary source. Because the\npatient is paralyzed, she is unable to increase her respiratory rate above the set rate to\ncompensate for the metabolic acidosis."

        "explanation": "This patient presents with a slowly progressive illness manifested\nby dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, clubbing, and the presence of crackles on examination. In\naddition, the pulmonary function tests demonstrate restrictive lung disease. This scenario is\ncharacteristic of an individual with interstitial lung disease, most commonly idiopathic\npulmonary fibrosis in individuals at this age. A more thorough history should be obtained to\ndetermine if there are any other exposures or symptoms that could identify other causes of\ninterstitial lung disease. The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a high-\nresolution CT scan (HRCT) of the chest. HRCT employs thinner cross-sectional images at\napproximately 1\u20132 mm rather than the usual 7\u201310 mm. This creates more visible details and is\nparticularly useful for recognizing subtle changes of the interstitium and small airways including\ninterstitial lung disease, bronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial\nbiopsy typically does not provide the detail required to adequately diagnose interstitial lung\ndisease. It may be considered if there are specific features on HRCT that would suggest an\nalternative diagnosis. However, in most instances, the pathologic diagnosis of interstitial lung\ndisease requires a surgical lung biopsy to provide definitive diagnosis. This patient\u2019s symptoms\ndo not suggest coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. Thus, echocardiography and\nnuclear stress testing are not indicated. CT scanning has evolved over the years to offer several\ndifferent techniques that are useful in a variety of circumstances. Standard CT imaging is most\nuseful for the evaluation and staging of lung masses. Helical CT scanning requires only a single\nbreath hold and provides continuous collection of data with improved contrast enhancement and\nthinner collimation. Once the data are obtained, the images can be reconstructed into other\nviews including sagittal and coronal planes as well as three-dimensional volumetric\nrepresentations. A recent use of this technology is employed in the setting of virtual\nbronchoscopy to aid in the planning and performance of bronchoscopy. Multidectector CT scans\ncan obtain multiple slices in a single rotation that are thinner than the usual cuts. Multidetector\nCT scanners are used in the performance of the CT pulmonary angiogram."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with interplay between genetic\nand environmental factors (Table VI-13). Several risk factors that predispose to asthma have\nbeen identified. These should be distinguished from triggers, which are environmental factors\nthat worsen asthma in a patient with established disease. Atopy is the major risk factor for\nasthma, and nonatopic individuals have a very low risk of developing asthma. Patients with\nasthma commonly suffer from other atopic diseases, particularly allergic rhinitis, which may be\nfound in over 80% of asthmatic patients, and atopic dermatitis (eczema). The familial association\nof asthma and a high degree of concordance for asthma in identical twins indicate a genetic\npredisposition to the disease; however, whether or not the genes predisposing to asthma are\nsimilar or in addition to those predisposing to atopy is not yet clear. It now seems likely that\ndifferent genes may also contribute to asthma specifically, and there is increasing evidence that\nthe severity of asthma is also genetically determined. Although viral infections (especially\nrhinovirus) are common triggers of asthma exacerbations, it is uncertain whether they play a\nrole in etiology. There is some association between respiratory syncytial virus infection in\ninfancy and the development of asthma, but the specific pathogenesis is difficult to elucidate\nbecause this infection is very common in children. The role of dietary factors is controversial.\nObservational studies have shown that diets low in antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin\nA, magnesium, selenium, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (fish oil) or high in sodium and\nomega-6 polyunsaturated fats are associated with an increased risk of asthma. Vitamin D\ndeficiency may also predispose to the development of asthma. However, interventional studies\nwith supplementary diets have not supported an important role for these dietary factors. Obesity\nis also an independent risk factor for asthma, particularly in women, but the mechanisms are\nthus far unknown. Air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, and diesel particulates, may\ntrigger asthma symptoms, but the role of different air pollutants in the etiology of the disease is\nmuch less certain. Most evidence argues against an important role for air pollution because\nasthma is no more prevalent in cities with a high ambient level of traffic pollution than in rural\nareas with low levels of pollution. There is some evidence that maternal smoking is a risk factor\nfor asthma, but it is difficult to dissociate this association from an increased risk of respiratory\ninfections.\nTALBLE VI-13   Risk Factors and Triggers Involved in Asthma"

        "explanation": "The patient in this clinical scenario presents with symptoms\ntypical of asthma, including shortness of breath and wheezing. She also manifests evidence of\natopy, the most common risk factor for developing asthma, with sensitivity to outdoor allergens\nand cats. In addition, the patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and eczema, both of which are\ncommonly seen in individuals with asthma. Indeed, over 80% of asthma patients have a\nconcomitant diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Atopy is present in 40%\u201350% of the population of\naffluent countries, but only a small proportion of these individuals develop asthma. Many studies\nhave shown a genetic predisposition via family history and recent genome-wide screens, but no\nsingle genetic profile has shown high positive predictive value. Overall, the prevalence of asthma\nin developed countries has increased over the past 30 years, but recently has leveled off, with a\nprevalence of about 15% in children and 10%\u201312% in adults. Asthma deaths remain rare and\nhave decreased in recent decades. In the 1960s, asthma deaths did increase with an overuse of\nshort-acting \u03b2-agonist medications. However, since the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids as\nmaintenance therapy, deaths have declined. Risk factors for fatal asthma include frequent use of\nrescue inhalers, lack of therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, and prior hospitalizations for\nasthma. Interestingly, the overall disease severity does not vary significantly within a given\npatient over the course of the disease. Individuals who have mild asthma typically continue to\nhave mild asthma, whereas those with severe disease present with severe disease. Diagnosis of\nasthma can be made by demonstrating airflow obstruction with significant reversibility on\nbronchodilator administration. In this case, the FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased to 70%, which is\nlow. In addition, the FEV1 increases by 12.4% and 230 mL. This meets the criteria for\nbronchodilator reversibility of increases of at least 200 mL and 12%.

Another common finding in all asthmatics and individuals with eosinophilic\nbronchitis is thickening of the basement membrane due to collagen deposition in the\nsubepithelium. The airway smooth muscle is hypertrophied as well. Overall, this leads to\nthickening of the airway wall, which may also exhibit edematous fluid, particularly in those with\nfatal asthma. In cases of fatal asthma, it is also common to find multiple airways that are\noccluded by mucus plugs.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The main drugs for asthma can be divided into bronchodilators,\nwhich give rapid relief of symptoms mainly through relaxation of airway smooth muscle, and\ncontrollers, which inhibit the underlying inflammatory process (Figure VI-17). For patients with\nmild, intermittent asthma, a short-acting \u03b22-agonist is all that is required. However, use of a\nreliever medication more than twice a week indicates the need for regular controller therapy.\nThis patient is using her reliever medication frequently; therefore, a controller should be added\nto her regimen. The treatment of choice for all patients is an inhaled corticosteroid given twice\ndaily. It is usual to start with an intermediate dose (e.g., 200 \u03bcg twice a day of beclomethasone\ndipropionate or equivalent) and to decrease the dose if symptoms are controlled after 3 months.\nIf symptoms are not controlled, a long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA) should be added, which is most\nconveniently given by switching to a combination inhaler. The dose of controller should be\nadjusted accordingly, as judged by the need for a rescue inhaler. Muscarinic receptor antagonists\nsuch as ipratropium bromide prevent cholinergic nerve-induced bronchoconstriction and mucus\nsecretion. They are less effective than \u03b22-agonists in asthma therapy because they inhibit only\nthe cholinergic reflex component of bronchoconstriction, whereas \u03b22-agonists prevent all\nbronchoconstrictor mechanisms. Anticholinergics, including tiotropium, may be used as\nadditional bronchodilators in patients with asthma that is not controlled by inhaled\ncorticosteroid and LABA combinations. Low doses of theophylline or an antileukotriene may also\nbe considered as an add-on therapy, but these are less effective than LABA.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Approximately one-third of asthmatic patients who are pregnant\nimprove during the course of a pregnancy, one-third deteriorate, and one-third are unchanged. It\nis important to maintain good control of asthma because poor control may have adverse effects\non fetal development. Compliance may be a problem because there is often concern about the\neffects of antiasthma medications on fetal development. The drugs that have been used for many\nyears in asthma therapy have now been shown to be safe and without teratogenic potential.\nThese drugs include short-acting \u03b2-agonists (e.g., albuterol), inhaled corticosteroids (e.g.,\nbeclomethasone), and theophylline; there is less safety information about newer classes of drugs\nsuch as LABAs (e.g., salmeterol), antileukotrienes, and anti\u2013immunoglobulin (Ig) E. If an oral\ncorticosteroid is needed, it is better to use prednisone rather than prednisolone because it cannot\nbe converted to the active prednisolone by the fetal liver, thus protecting the fetus from systemic\neffects of the corticosteroid. There is no contraindication to breast-feeding when patients are\nusing these drugs."

She was well and healthy until 4 days prior when she abruptly began to feel ill with fevers, chills, bilateral pleuritic chest pain, and worsening shortness of breath. She has no significant past medical history but has suffered the recent death of her father following a car accident. In coping with his loss, she began smoking cigarettes again after a 15-year period of abstinence. She has been smoking up to two packs of tobacco daily. After she began to feel ill, she started taking acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine, but otherwise takes no medications. Upon arrival in the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was 78% on room air. On a non-rebreather mask, the oxygen saturation increased to 92%. The vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.7\u00b0C (101.7\u00b0), heart rate 122 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 132/82 mmHg.

        "explanation": "Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is an acute respiratory syndrome\nthat often presents with a clinical picture that is difficult to differentiate from acute lung injury\nor acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinically, patients present with a prodrome of\nfevers, malaise, myalgias, night sweats, dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Physical\nexamination may demonstrate high fevers, bibasilar rales, and rhonchi. The clinical course is\nfrequently marked by rapid clinical progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure that requires\nmechanical ventilation. Chest radiography shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. This clinical\npicture clearly overlaps with infectious causes of respiratory failure and ARDS. However, the\nhallmark of acute eosinophilic pneumonia is the finding of >25% eosinophils in the\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia most frequently presents in\nindividuals between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is more common in men. There is no\nepidemiologic link between the diagnosis and a prior history of asthma. However, several case\nreports have linked development of acute eosinophilic pneumonia to recent initiation of cigarette\nsmoking or exposure to other environmental stimuli including dust. A bronchoalveolar lavage\nshowing eosinophilia >25% is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic\npneumonia. A surgical lung biopsy is not necessary. If performed, it would demonstrate\neosinophilic infiltration with acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage. Peripheral\neosinophilia is not present acutely at disease onset, but often becomes present between day 7\nand day 30. Other organ failure is not present. The disease has a high degree of corticosteroid\nresponsiveness and a good prognosis. Initiation of therapy with corticosteroids should not be\ndelayed. Although there is no recommended dose of steroids for therapy, patients are often\ninitiated on therapy with intravenous glucocorticoids with rapid improvement in the hypoxemic\nrespiratory failure. The expected clinical course is complete resolution of clinical and\nradiographic features of the disease over several weeks without relapse upon tapering of steroids."

Initial diagnostic testing should include demonstration of elevated circulating IgE level\n(option D), typically >1000 IU/mL. Peripheral eosinophilia is also commonly seen. If the IgE\nlevel is elevated and suggestive of IgE, one must demonstrate sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens.\nThis can be achieved by skin test reactivity, positive serum precipitins for Aspergillus, and/or\ndirect measurement of circulating specific IgG and IgE to Aspergillus. Testing for specific IgE in\nthe serum is most frequent accomplished via radioallergosorbent (RAST) testing. Chest CT\n(option B) may show central bronchiectasis as the classic manifestation of ABPA but is present in\nonly about 30% of individuals.

        "explanation": "Mesothelioma is a rare malignancy of the pleura and peritoneum,\nwith almost all cases associated with asbestos exposure. It is notable that the exposure to\nasbestos could seem almost minimal but still confer significant risk. Exposures of less than 1\u20132\nyears or that have occurred more than 40 years in the past have been demonstrated to confer\nincreased risk of mesothelioma. Although tobacco smoking in association with asbestos exposure\nincreases the risk of lung cancer several-fold, there is no additive or exponential risk of\nmesothelioma in those who smoke. Mesothelioma most often presents with a persistent unilateral\npleural effusion that may mask the underlying pleural tumor. However, the pleura may be\ndiffusely thickened. Typically, large pleural effusions would cause expansion of the hemithorax\nwith mediastinal shift away from the side of the pleural effusion. However, even with large\neffusions, no mediastinal shift is seen on chest radiograph because the pleural thickening\nassociated with the disease leads to a fixed chest cavity size and thoracic restriction. The most\ndifficult diagnostic dilemma in these patients is to differentiate mesothelioma from metastatic\nlung carcinoma (usually adenocarcinoma) as many patients are at risk for both tumors, and lung\ncancer is by far the most common malignancy seen in individuals with asbestos exposure and\ncigarette smoking. Pleural fluid cytology is not adequate for the diagnosis of most individuals\nwith mesothelioma, with samples being positive for the disease in less than 50% of individuals.\nMost often, video-assisted thoracoscopy is required to directly visualize the pleural and direct\nbiopsy sampling. Unfortunately, there is no proven effective therapy for mesothelioma, and most\npatients die from local extension of the disease."

When evaluating a patient for a\nnew pulmonary diagnosis, it is important to perform a detailed occupational history to determine\nif there is a possibility that the patient\u2019s profession may be causing or perpetuating the disease\nprocess. Specific clinical syndromes are associated with well-defined clinical exposures. The\ninorganic dusts include asbestos, silica, coal dust, beryllium, and a variety of other metals.\nAsbestos and silica are among the most common exposures. Asbestos exposure is associated with\nmining, construction, and ship repair. In areas near where asbestos mining has occurred, the\ngeneral population also has shown an increased risk of asbestos-related lung disease. Clinically,\nasbestos exposure is associated with a range of clinical syndromes including asbestosis\n(interstitial lung disease), benign pleural plaques and pleural effusions, lung cancer, and\nmesothelioma. Silica exposure is common among miners, stone masons, and individuals involved\nin sand blasting or quarrying. A variety of clinical syndrome can occur with silica exposure, the\nmost severe being progressive massive fibrosis with mass-like upper lobe consolidating nodules\n(>1 cm). Coal mining is also associated with a clinical picture similar to silicosis and progressive\nmassive fibrosis. Beryllium is a lightweight metal that is highly conductive and is used in high-\ntech industries. The classic disease associated with beryllium exposure is a chronic\ngranulomatous disease similar in clinical appearance to sarcoidosis. Other metals can produce\nany number of clinical syndromes. Welders of galvanized metal who use zinc oxide are\nsusceptible to metal fume fever and present with an acute self-limited influenza-like illness.\n    Organic dusts that can lead to occupational lung disease include cotton dust, grain dust, toxic\nchemicals, and other agricultural dusts, among many others. Cotton milling and processing can\npresent with a clinical syndrome known as byssinosis, which has asthma-like features. Many of\nthe organic dust exposures also lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Examples of\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis syndromes related to occupational exposures include farmer\u2019s lung,\npigeon breeder\u2019s lung, and malt worker\u2019s lung. Typically, a specific antigen can be identified as\nthe culprit for the development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In farmer\u2019s lung, the most\ncommon cause is thermophilic Actinomyces species found in moldy hay."

Historically,\nbronchiectasis has been characterized pathologically as cylindrical, varicose, or cystic in nature.\nThere are numerous causes of bronchiectasis including infectious, inherited, immunologic, and\nidiopathic causes. The most common cause of bronchiectasis worldwide is postinfectious\nfollowing tuberculosis infection. However, in developed countries, other causes are more\ncommon. The most common cause in developed countries is cystic fibrosis (CF); CF patients\ndevelop clinically significant bronchiectasis in late adolescence or early adulthood. Most children\nwith CF are diagnosed currently through newborn screening programs, which were introduced in\nall states within the past decade. However, adults may continue to present with milder forms of\nthe disease, so clinicians should continue to have a high degree of clinical suspicion for CF when\nan individual presents with a new diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Epidemiologically, individuals\npresenting with CF bronchiectasis will typically be younger than individuals with non-CF\nbronchiectasis. In contrast, non-CF bronchiectasis more commonly affects nonsmoking women\nolder than 50 years. The clinical presentation of bronchiectasis is a daily cough productive of\nthick tenacious sputum. Physical examination demonstrates both crackles and wheezing on\nexamination. In CF, the disease findings are more predominant in the upper lobes, whereas in\ncertain other causes (chronic aspiration, immunoglobulin deficiency), there is a lower lobe\npredominance. Clubbing is variably present and generally only seen in more advance disease.\nThe diagnosis of bronchiectasis is determined by the presence of the disease on a chest CT\nimaging. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, particularly early\nin the disease process. It may show \u201ctram tracks\u201d indicating dilated airway. Chest HRCT is the\ndiagnostic modality of choice for confirming diagnosis. Findings include demonstration of\ndilated, nontapering airways that may be filled with mucus. In addition, signet-ring signs may\nalso be seen where the airway is greater than 1.5 times the size of the adjacent blood vessel.\nOther findings include bronchial wall thickening, inspissated secretion with a \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d\npattern, and cysts emanating from the bronchial wall. Once bronchiectasis has been confirmed\non CT imaging, other tests may be indicated in this patient to determine the etiology of the\nbronchiectasis. Testing should be guided by the history and physical examination and may\ninclude sputum culture for mycobacteria and fungal organisms, immunoglobulin levels,\nautoimmune panel, sweat chloride testing, nasal nitric oxide testing (for primary ciliary\ndyskinesia), bronchoscopy, and/or tests of swallow function. Despite thorough evaluation, in as\nmany as 25%\u201350% of individuals referred for workup of bronchiectasis, no specific cause is ever\nidentified."

        "explanation": "Cystic fibrosis is one of the\nmost common life-shortening autosomal recessive disorders, affecting about 1 in 3300 live births\nin Caucasians. It is much less common in African Americans (~1 in 15,000) and Asians (~1 in\n33,000). The disease is caused by an inherited defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane\nregulator (CFTR) protein, a large ion channel in the cell membrane responsible for chloride ion\ntransport. In the absence of a functional CFTR protein, individuals with CF have a variety of\ndisease manifestations related to impaired exocrine function. The primary disease manifestations\nare respiratory and pancreatic in nature with chronic sinopulmonary infections, impaired\nexocrine pancreatic function, and poor nutrition. The gene that encodes CFTR is located on\nchromosome 7, and more than 2000 mutations have been described. In understanding the\ngenetics, it is best to categorize them according to the effect on CFTR function. Class I mutations\n(G542X, 621+1G>T) lead to absence of synthesis, most frequently through the presence of an\nabnormal stop codon. Class II mutations (F508del, the most common mutation) cause defective\nprotein synthesis and premature degradation. Class III mutations (G551D) are gating mutations,\nin which the CFTR protein is present at the cell membrane but fails to function properly. Type IV\nmutations (R117H, R117C) are conductance mutations with impaired conductance through the\nion channel pore, and Type V mutations are splice mutations that lead to a diminished number\nof CFTR transcripts being produced due to a promoter or splicing abnormality. One of the most\nexciting breakthroughs in the treatment of CF has been in the area of CFTR modulations. High-\nthroughput screening identified small-molecule compounds that act as potentiators or correctors\nof CFTR and improve CFTR function. The first of these compounds to be identified was ivacaftor.\nThis drug works as a potentiator and has been approved for individuals with gating mutations,\nthe most common of which is G551D. Approximately 5% of the CF population has a gating\nmutation. In clinical trials, individuals with a G551D mutation treated with ivacaftor\nexperienced an absolute improvement in lung function (FEV1 percent predicted) of 10.6% and a\ndecline in sweat chloride values to normal levels. This was sustained over the 24 weeks of the\nclinical trial. Long-term data are now available that demonstrates persistent effects of ivacaftor\nup to 144 weeks (McKone EF et al: Lancet Respir Med 2014;2(11):902\u2013910). Individuals on\nivacaftor also experience an improvement in nutritional status and growth in younger\nindividuals as well. Ivacaftor is now being combined with corrector compounds such as\nlumacaftor to attempt to correct the F508del processing abnormality. The combination of\nivacaftor and lumacaftor was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July\n2015 for individuals homozygous for F508del. Other potentiator/corrector combinations are\nundergoing clinical trials."

        "explanation": "The answer is E. (Chap. 313 and J Pediatr 2008;153(2):S4\u2013S14) CF is a common autosomal\nrecessive disorder that affects 1 out of every 3300 live births in the Caucasian population of\nNorth America and Europe. There have been more than 2000 mutations identified in the gene\nfor the CFTR protein\u2014the abnormal protein identified in CF. This protein is a large\ntransmembrane protein involved in the transport of chloride and other ions, and abnormalities of\nthe CFTR lead to abnormalities of salt and water transport. The primary clinical manifestations\nof CF are due to the effects of the mutated CFTR in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and\npancreas. In the lungs, abnormal CFTR leads to thick, sticky mucus with abnormal mucociliary\nclearance. A patient will have recurrent respiratory infections with development of cystic\nbronchiectasis over time. The presenting manifestation in infancy is often meconium ileus and\ncan lead to constipation and distal intestinal obstruction in adults. Failure of the CFTR in the\npancreas prevents appropriate release of pancreatic enzymes to allow for proper digestion of\nfood, especially fatty foods, with resultant malnutrition and steatorrhea. While most patients\nwith CF present in infancy or childhood, about 5% of all individuals with CF will not be\ndiagnosed until adulthood. Presenting symptoms in adulthood can be myriad and often result\nfrom minor mutations of the CFTR gene. These symptoms can include recurrent lung and sinus\ninfections, malnutrition, sinus disease, and infertility, especially absence of the vas deferens in\nmen. The standard test for the diagnosis of CF is the sweat chloride test. Elevated values are\npathognomonic for CF, with a cutoff of >60 mmol/L in adults being diagnostic. Values greater\nthan 40 mmol/L fall within the indeterminate range. Given the large number of mutations that\ncan cause CF, genetic testing can be expensive and is not the first test performed when CF is\nsuspected. A screening CF genetic panel often only identifies between approximately 20 and 80\nof the common CF mutations. If only one mutation is identified, then this may represent the\ncarrier state, or it could represent CF with a more rare mutation requiring more detailed genetic\nanalysis, including full gene sequencing. In such cases, referral to a tertiary CF care center is\nhelpful for data interpretation. In some instances, nasal potential difference testing can be\nhelpful because CF patients demonstrate an elevated baseline nasal potential difference with\nfailure to respond to stimulation with \u03b2-agonists. Presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common\nin adults with CF but is not specific for the diagnosis of the disease because bronchiectasis from\nany cause can lead to P aeruginosa colonization."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The answer is C. (Chap. 313 and Ann Am Thorac Soc 2014;11(10):1640\u20131650) Individuals with\nCF experience recurrent pulmonary and sinus infections. In childhood, the most commonly\nisolated organisms are Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. However, over time,\nmost adults demonstrate P aeruginosa. It is now recognized that chronic colonization with\nPseudomonas, especially multidrug-resistant organisms, is associated with a more rapid decline in\nlung function. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends quarterly office visits with a\nphysician with assessment of respiratory cultures at each visit. When Pseudomonas is initially\ndetected, attempts to eradicate the organism should be undertaken. The recommended regimen\nfor eradication is an inhaled antibiotic with the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin as the\npreferred agent. This will be continued every other month until the next office visit to determine\nif therapy should be continued. For all patients chronically colonized with Pseudomonas, inhaled\ntobramycin every other month should be continued on an indefinite basis. In addition,\nazithromycin 500 mg three times weekly or 250 mg daily is also used. Whether azithromycin\nprimarily exerts its beneficial effect through anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial actions is not\ndefinitively known at the present time. Because the patient is clinically well without any\nsymptoms of acute exacerbation, the use of intravenous antibiotics is not required. Chest wall\noscillation and hypertonic saline are both mechanisms to improve airway clearance. While the\npatient may need to improve airway clearance in the future, the most important component of\nhis care at present is to eradicate new growth of Pseudomonas. His current exercise regimen and\nautogenic drainage provide a component of airway clearance in his maintenance care plan."

        "explanation": "Acute exacerbations of COPD are a frequent cause of morbidity\nand mortality in COPD, contributing to >70% of healthcare expenditures for COPD. Risk factors\nfor development of acute exacerbation include severity of airflow obstruction (FEV1 <50%\npredicted), history of prior exacerbations, and elevated ratio of pulmonary artery to aorta on\nchest CT. Acute exacerbations of COPD cost over $10 billion to the healthcare system in the\nUnited States annually. Thus, determining the causes of exacerbations and prevention of future\nexacerbations have been important targets in the care of COPD patients. Most acute\nexacerbations are associated with airway inflammation or infection, including acquiring a new\nstrain of bacteria or a viral respiratory infection. Therefore, strategies for prevention have been\nprimarily focused on decreasing inflammatory responses and preventing infections. The selective\nphosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast has been demonstrated to decrease exacerbation\nfrequency in individuals with COPD who have symptoms of chronic bronchitis and frequent\nexacerbations. However, it has limited effects of pulmonary function and chronic respiratory\nsymptoms. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has both anti-inflammatory and antibiotic\nproperties. In a randomized controlled trial, it has been shown to decrease exacerbation\nfrequency and increase time to first exacerbation when administered at a dose of 500 mg daily,\nnot 250 mg three times weekly. Other interventions that also decrease exacerbation frequency\ninclude use of inhaled glucocorticoids in individuals with frequent exacerbations or asthmatic\nsymptoms and influenza vaccination. Long-acting anticholinergic medications and long-acting \u03b2-\nagonists decrease exacerbations as well. Oxygen therapy and nocturnal ventilation are not\nindicated for prevention of exacerbations. Theophylline yields modest improvements in lung\nfunction but has no proven effect on exacerbations."

Worldwide, COPD is also increasing as\ncigarette smoking, the primary risk factor for the development of COPD, is increasing in\nprevalence throughout the world. While cigarette smoking is clearly identified as a risk factor for\nCOPD, other factors have also been identified to contribute to the risk of COPD. In many\ndeveloping countries, the prevalence of smoking among women remains low. However, the\nincidence of COPD is increasing in women as well as men. In many developing countries, this\nincreased incidence of COPD in women is attributable to the use of biomass fuels in poorly\nventilated areas for heat and cooking. In addition, passive cigarette smoke exposure may also\ncontribute. Occupational exposures also lead to an increased risk of COPD. Although some\nexposures such as cotton textile dust and gold mining have not been definitively associated with\nCOPD, coal dust exposure is a risk factor for emphysema in both smokers and nonsmokers.\nInherent properties of the airways also affect the risk of COPD.

        "options": [],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "COPD is a disease process encompassing the clinical entities of\nemphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is defined pathophysiologically by the presence of\nirreversible airflow obstruction with hyperinflation and impaired gas exchange. The airflow\nobstruction occurs for several reasons including decreased elastic recoil of the lungs, increased\nairway inflammation, and increased closure of small airways due to loss of tethering in\nemphysematous lungs. This leads to early closure of airways in expiration with air trapping and\nhyperinflation. Finally, the loss of alveoli in emphysematous lungs leads to a progressive decline\nin gas exchange with alterations of ventilation-perfusion relationships. On pulmonary function\ntesting, these pathophysiologic changes result in a typical pattern with the primary characteristic\nof COPD being a decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1. The severity of airflow obstruction is\ngraded by the degree of decline in the percent predicted FEV1. The FVC may or may not be\ndecreased. With hyperinflation, the TLC increases with a concomitant increase in RV. Finally, the\nDLCO is also characteristically decreased in most cases of COPD. Some patients with pure\nchronic bronchitis without any emphysematous component may have a preserved DLCO,\nalthough this is a rare presentation for COPD. This same pattern of pulmonary function testing\ncan be seen in asthma with the exception of the DLCO, which is typically normal asthma. A\ndecrease in TLC is characteristic in restrictive ventilator disorders, such as pulmonary fibrosis,\nbut not in obstructive disorders such as COPD."

Acute exacerbations of COPD\naccount for more than $10 billion in healthcare expenditures annually in the United States, with\nsignificant morbidity and mortality associated with these exacerbations. Prompt treatment can\nimprove symptoms and decrease hospitalizations and mortality in this setting. In patients\npresenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of an acute exacerbation, the\ntreatment that has demonstrated the strongest reduction in mortality, when compared to\ntraditional mechanical ventilation, is noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). NIPPV\nalso decreases the need for endotracheal intubation, complications, and length of stay in the\nhospital. Antibiotics, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids are all cornerstones of therapy in the\ntreatment of acute exacerbations in COPD but have not been demonstrated in clinical trials to\nhave similar mortality benefits in the situation of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.\nSpecifically, no benefit is demonstrated for intravenous versus oral corticosteroids. Likewise, the\nchoice of antibiotic should be made based on local susceptibility patterns, and need for broad-\nspectrum antibiotics that cover for Pseudomonas is not typically indicated.

        "explanation": "This patient is presenting with subacute pulmonary symptoms,\nintermittent fevers, myalgias, and malaise. The biopsy shows a pattern of cryptogenic organizing\npneumonia (COP). COP (formerly bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) usually\npresents in the fifth or sixth decades with a flulike illness. Symptoms include fevers, malaise,\nweight loss, cough, and dyspnea. Inspiratory crackles are common, and late inspiratory squeaks\nmay also be heard. Pulmonary function testing reveals restrictive lung disease. The typical\npattern on chest HRCT is patchy areas of airspace consolidation, nodular opacities, and ground-\nglass opacities that occur more frequently in the lower lung zones. Pathology shows the presence\nof granulation tissue plugging airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. There is frequently chronic\ninflammation in the alveolar interstitium. Treatment with high-dose steroids is effective in two-\nthirds of individuals, with most individuals being able to be tapered to lower doses over the first\nyear. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive therapy that is commonly used in interstitial lung\ndisease due to usual interstitial pneumonitis. While it may be considered in COP unresponsive to\nglucocorticoids, it would not be a first-line agent used without concomitant steroid therapy.\nBecause most patients with COP respond to corticosteroids, referral for lung transplantation is\nnot required unless there is a failure to respond to therapy. Nintedanib and pirfenidone are\ntreatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."

If undetected, it will rapidly progress to\ncardiovascular collapse and death. Tension pneumothorax most commonly occurs during\nmechanical ventilation and during resuscitative efforts. An initial sign during mechanical\nventilation is high peak inspiratory pressures or difficulty with ventilation. Hypotension and\nhypoxemia are signs of impending cardiovascular collapse and are caused by decreased venous\nreturn to the heart and reduced cardiac output. The physical examination may show absence of\nbreath sounds on the affected side with enlargement of the hemithorax, hyperresonance to\npercussion, and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. A chest radiograph would be\nconfirmatory, but in an acute setting, there may not be time to obtain the testing. If clinical\nsuspicion is high, treatment should not be delayed as tension pneumothorax is a medical\nemergency and the patient is likely to die if the tension is not relieved. A large-bore needle\nshould be placed into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space. If a large\namount of air escapes after the needle is inserted, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should\nremain in place until definitive treatment with a tube thoracostomy can be performed."

When an effusion is identified in association with pneumonia, it is\nprudent to perform a thoracentesis if the fluid can be safely accessed. One way to know whether\nthere is enough fluid for thoracentesis is to perform a lateral decubitus film and observe if there\nis free-flowing fluid at a volume of >10 mm from the chest wall.

A loculated effusion often indicates an\ninfected effusion and may require chest tube drainage or surgical intervention. Other factors that\nare associated with the need for more invasive procedures include pleural fluid pH <7.20,\npleural fluid glucose <60 mg/dL (<3.3 mmol/L), positive Gram stain or culture of the pleural\nfluid, and presence of gross pus in the pleural space (empyema).

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of\ntrauma to the thorax. Most individuals who present with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax\nare young, and primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs almost exclusively in cigarette\nsmokers, the primary risk factor. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is also more common in\nmen and has been associated with a tall, thin body habitus. The primary cause is the rupture of\nsmall apical pleural blebs or cysts, and the CT scan of the chest is often normal. About half of\nindividuals will experience more than one primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The initial\ntreatment is simple needle aspiration, which is most commonly done with ultrasound or CT\nguidance. Oxygen is given simultaneously to speed resorption of the residual air in the pleural\nspace. If conservative treatment fails, tube thoracostomy can be performed. Pneumothoraces that\nfail to resolve or are recurrent often require thoracoscopy with stapling of blebs and pleural\nabrasion, a treatment that is effective in almost 100% of cases."

        "explanation": "Chronic fibrosing mediastinitis most commonly occurs after\ngranulomatous inflammation in the lymph nodes in the mediastinum that leads to an exuberant\ncalcification response. Over time, the inflammation can cause significant disruption to the vital\nstructures that course through the mediastinum and lead to the clinical symptoms of fibrosing\nmediastinitis. The most common causes of fibrosing mediastinitis are histoplasmosis and\ntuberculosis. Other causes include sarcoidosis, silicosis, or other fungal diseases. Symptoms are\nrelated to compression of mediastinal structures including the superior vena cava, pulmonary\narteries or veins, or large airway compression. The phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerves may\nalso become paralyzed. The most common symptom is dyspnea on exertion. Patients may also\ndevelop chronic cough with lithoptysis or hemoptysis due to erosion of the calcific lymph nodes\ninto airways. Patients may describe lithoptysis as gritty or sandy sputum. Hemoptysis can be\nlarge volume and may necessitate surgical intervention for control. However, other than\nantituberculous therapy for tuberculous mediastinitis, no medical or surgical therapy has any\neffectiveness on the treatment of fibrosing mediastinitis.

However, the prevalence is expected to increase as the prevalence of obesity is rising\nworldwide. OHS requires a body mass index >30 kg/m2 and the presence of chronic alveolar\nhypoventilation for diagnosis, with a daytime awake PaCO2 \u226545 mmHg. In more than 90% of\ncases, concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also present. The pathogenesis of OHS is not\nfully understood, although it is known that there is a downregulation of the central respiratory\ndrive in response to carbon dioxide. Multiple physiologic factors acting together likely lead to\nthis including OSA, increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle impairment, V/Q\nmismatching, and depressed central chemo-responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Most\npatients present with daytime sleepiness, headaches, and symptoms typical of OSA. These\npatients should be treated with weight loss and positive airway pressure therapy. Sustained\nweight loss will lead to improvements in PaCO2 over time. Continuous positive airway pressure\n(CPAP) therapy does lead to improvement in daytime hypercapnia and hypoxemia in more than\nhalf of patients with OHS and OSA but is not recommended for use if patients have sustained\nhypoxemia after resolution of obstructive apneic events. In these individuals bilevel positive\nairway pressure (BiPAP) therapy is used. BiPAP is also used if a patient cannot tolerate the\ntypically high levels of CPAP required for treatment. Some patients with OHS may present\nacutely with decompensated symptoms of right heart failure and respiratory failure as in this\nscenario. When a patient presents in acute decompensated OHS, BiPAP is the treatment of choice\nacutely as well. Even in patients who have previously failed home noninvasive therapy, this\nremains the treatment of choice for their acute condition and may prevent intubation and\nmechanical ventilation. The PHOX2b gene mutation plays no role in OHS but is associated with\ncongenital central hypoventilation syndromes."

        "explanation": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a\ncommon condition estimated to affect up to 2%\u201315% of middle-aged individuals and >20% of\nelderly individuals and is associated with repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep.\nThis patient exhibits multiple risk factors and gives a strong history to support a diagnosis of\nOSAHS, placing him at high risk to have moderate to severe OSAHS. The greatest risk factor the\npatient has that places him at high risk for disease is obesity. Approximately 40%\u201360% of cases\nof OSAHS are attributable to excess body weight. The second major risk factor for OSAHS is\nmale sex because men are two to four times more likely to have OSAHS than women. The\nreasons men develop more OSAHS include greater central obesity and relatively longer\npharyngeal length, which in turn contribute to greater upper airway collapsibility. In addition,\nfemale sex hormones provide a stabilizing effect on the upper airway and stimulate ventilatory\ndrive. Thus, premenopausal women are relatively protected from OSAHS at comparable levels of\nobesity when compared to men. Other risk factors that this patient has include a positive family\nhistory of the disease and hypertension. Other common risk factors for OSAHS in the general\npopulation include craniofacial abnormalities, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, various endocrine\nsyndromes (acromegaly, hypothyroidism), increasing age, and some ethnic groups. For instance,\nindividuals of Asian descent often develop OSAHS at a lower range of body mass index, most\nlikely due to ethnic difference in craniofacial structure. In addition, individuals of African\nAmerican race are at higher risk of OSAHS when compared to whites. This patient also gives\nmany symptoms that are concerning for OSAHS including loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and\ndaytime sleepiness. Given that there is a high clinical suspicion of disease, home sleep testing\nwill likely be adequate for diagnosis of disease in this patient. Home sleep tests can be performed\nin a variety of ways, but most will record respiratory effort, nasal flow, and oxygen saturation. In\na patient with a high suspicion of disease, these tests can be a cost-efficient means of diagnosis.\nHowever, the home tests may yield false-negative results because these tests do not measure the\nelectroencephalogram, and thus, no accurate measure of sleep time is obtained. Therefore, the\nrespiratory events are determined based on total recording time rather than total sleep time. If a\npatient is awake during much of the recording time, this could cause a false-negative result. An\nattended in-lab polysomnogram remains the gold standard for diagnosis OSAHS but is\nsignificantly more expensive. In this individual with a high pretest suspicion of disease, the cost\nwould not be justified. An overnight oximetry provides only oxygen levels and heart rate and is\nnot adequate for diagnosis of OSAHS. Treatment with a CPAP device may be recommended after\na diagnosis is confirmed, but this would not be the next step in the treatment of the patient. The\npatient has only minimally enlarged tonsils. A tonsillectomy would not be expected to alleviate\nhis symptoms."

        "explanation": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of central sleep apnea\nassociated with hypocapnia and demonstrates a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of breathing.\nPathophysiologically, this occurs because the baseline carbon dioxide during wakefulness is\nbelow the apneic threshold during sleep. Thus, at sleep onset, a central apneic event occurs\nallowing carbon dioxide to rise. When this rise in carbon dioxide is detected centrally, there is an\nexaggerated respiratory response that leads to hyperpnea and hyperventilation, driving the\ncarbon dioxide levels below the apneic threshold again, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of\napnea and hyperpnea. It occurs more commonly in individuals with heart failure or atrial\nfibrillation due to a delay in circulation time. This prolonged circulation delay between the\npulmonary capillaries and the central carbon dioxide\u2013sensing chemoreceptors contributes to\nthese ongoing cycles of hyperpnea and apnea. In many individuals with Cheyne-Stokes\nrespiration, it has been observed that the pattern of breathing may worsen over the course of the\nnight and the fluid is redistributed centrally, further prolonging circulation time."

        "explanation": "The treatment of choice for most adults with OSAHS is nasal\nCPAP. CPAP delivers a set pressure that is sufficient to overcome the tendency of the posterior\noropharynx to collapse. This pressure ranges generally from 5\u201315 cmH2O, although pressures as\nhigh as 20 cmH2O can be used. However, the rates of adherence to CPAP therapy are highly\nvariable. Many patients complain of claustrophobia, nasal congestion, aerophagia, or facial pain.\nIf tolerated, there is a large body of data demonstrating beneficial effects of CPAP on blood\npressure, alertness, mood, and insulin sensitivity, and likely improvement in cardiovascular\noutcomes. Oral appliance therapy is generally considered second-line therapy in mild to\nmoderate OSA if the patient fails to tolerate CPAP. It can be prescribed as initial therapy if the\npatient prefers. In most studies, the improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index with oral\nappliance is \u226550% in about two-thirds of individuals. Side effects of oral appliances include\ntemporomandibular joint pain and tooth movement. Surgical interventions for OSAHS in adults\nhave provided less than desired benefits, and it can be difficult to determine which patients will\nderive \nthe \ngreatest \nbenefits \nin \nthe \nabsence \nof \na \nknown \nanatomic \nabnormality.\nUvulopalatopharyngoplasty is the most common surgical procedure over the past two decades\nand is associated with a success rate similar to oral appliance therapy. Weight loss is generally\nrecommended for all patients with OSAHS but should not be the only therapy recommended for\nan individual with this degree of OSAHS. Supplemental oxygen can improve oxygen saturation,\nbut there is little evidence that it improves OSAHS symptoms and the apnea-hypopnea index."

Although osteoporosis, posttransplantation lymphoproliferative\ndisorders, and chronic kidney disease are important complications of steroids, calcineurin\ninhibitors, and other agents used for immunosuppression, the major complications after\ntransplantation are in the lung. Primary graft dysfunction is a form of acute lung injury\nimmediately after lung transplantation that is relatively rare, with severe disease occurring in\nonly 10%\u201320% of cases. Airway complications such as anastomotic dehiscence or stenosis have\nsimilar occurrence rates, but can usually be managed bronchoscopically with good survival.\nRejection of transplanted organ is very common and is the main limitation to better medium-\nand long-term outcomes. Rejection occurs as acute cellular rejection often presenting with\ncough, low-grade fever, dyspnea, infiltrates on radiographs, and declining lung function. In\ncontrast, chronic rejection typically presents with advancing obstruction on pulmonary function\ntesting, \nno \ninfiltrates, \nand \nworsening \ndyspnea \non \nexertion. \nThis \nconstellation \nin\nposttransplantation patients is termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Fifty percent of lung\ntransplant patients have some degree of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and it is the main\nimpediment to better long-term survival.

        "explanation": "This patient has evidence of\nsevere ARDS. The annual incidence of ARDS is 60 cases per 100,000 population. In individuals\nadmitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, approximately 20% of these will meet the criteria\nfor ARDS, although it is generally underrecognized in the ICU population. ARDS is a clinical\nsyndrome of severe dyspnea of rapid onset, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates that\nmay lead to respiratory failure. There are myriad causes of ARDS, including sepsis, pneumonia,\naspiration pneumonitis, trauma, acute pancreatitis, multiple transfusions, and toxic inhalation\ninjury among others. The most common causes of ARDS are sepsis and pneumonia, which cause\nabout 40%\u201350% of all cases of ARDS. Clinically, ARDS is diagnosed in the presence of acute\nbilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia without evidence of increased left atrial filling\npressure. A consensus panel has recently revised the definition of ARDS into three categories of\nmild, moderate, and severe based on degree of hypoxemia as determined by the ratio of PaO2 to\nFiO2, commonly called P:F ratio. Mild ARDS is present if PaO2/FiO2 is \u2264300 mmHg, but >200\nmm Hg. Moderate ARDS is diagnosed when PaO2/FiO2 is \u2264200 mmHg and >100 mmHg.\nSevere ARDS is diagnosed when PaO2/FiO2 is \u2264100 mmHg. In this case, the ratio of PaO2 to\nFiO2 is 80 mmHg, placing the patient in the category of severe ARDS. The natural history of\nARDS is three stages: exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic. In the early exudative stage of ARDS,\nthere is an acute injury to alveolar capillary endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. This\nresults in loss of the normal alveolar barrier with subsequent leakage of protein-rich fluid into\nthe alveoli (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema). In the early phase, the inflammatory cell\ninfiltrate is predominantly neutrophils. Pathologically, the finding is described as diffuse alveolar\ndamage. Hyaline membranes and loss of type I pneumocytes are seen. The exudative phase of\nARDS lasts for approximately the first 7 days of illness. The second phase of ARDS is the\nproliferative phase, which begins around day 7 and continues through day 21. Most patients\nrecover during this phase and are able to be liberated from mechanical ventilation.\nHistologically, early signs of repair can be seen in this phase with shift to a lymphocyte-\npredominant infiltrate, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and organization of the alveolar\npredominant infiltrate, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and organization of the alveolar\nedema. Only a few individuals who develop ARDS fail to recover during the proliferative phase\nand continue into the fibrotic stage of the disease. Pathologically, individuals who develop\nfibrotic ARDS demonstrate extensive alveolar and interstitial fibrosis at sites of prior alveolar\nedema. The acinar architecture frequently becomes distorted, leading to development of\nemphysematous changes with large bullae. Fibrotic proliferation may also occur in the intima of\npulmonary vasculature, leading to development of pulmonary hypertension. Given the timing of\nthe presentation, this patient would be expected to be in the exudative phase of ARDS and\nexhibit diffuse alveolar damage, loss of type I pneumocytes, and hyaline membranes."

Mechanical ventilation is frequently\nnecessary for individuals suffering from ARDS and has been essential for prolonging life and\nimproving mortality from this disorder. However, appropriate ventilator management is\nnecessary to prevent further morbidity from ventilator-associated lung injury. ARDS is not\nexperienced uniformly across the lung tissue. The dependent portions of the lungs are typically\nthe most affected, while other areas of the lung may be spared. The portions of the lung that are\nmost affected are poorly compliant and are prone to alveolar collapse. Alternatively, the more\nnormal portions of the lungs have better lung compliance. With positive-pressure ventilation,\nventilator-associated lung injury may occur as a result of overdistention of the more normal\nareas of the lung with resultant perpetuation of alveolar damage and capillary leak in these\nareas. In the poorly compliant areas, respirations initiated by the ventilator can lead to repetitive\nopening and closure of alveoli, causing further damage in these areas. Because of this, a strategy\nthat employs low tidal volumes to prevent alveolar overdistention and recurrent alveolar\ncollapse is recommended. The ARDS Network conducted a clinical trial that compared low tidal\nvolume ventilation to conventional ventilation and demonstrated improved mortality with the\nlow tidal volume strategy (31% vs. 40%). The recommended initial tidal volume setting is 6\nmL/kg of ideal body weight. This strategy is recommended in all patients with ARDS, and the\nimprovement in outcomes is not affected by obesity."

In turn, there is significant loss\nof lung compliance and development of alveolar collapse that is worse in the dependent portions\nof the lungs. During mechanical ventilation, the goal is to minimize overdistention of less\naffected areas of the lungs while maximizing alveolar recruitment. Positive end-expiratory\npressure (PEEP) is used to prevent alveolar collapse at end-expiration. Trials of mechanical\nventilation with high-PEEP compared to low-PEEP strategies did not show any differences in\noutcomes when a low tidal volume ventilation strategy was used. More recently, a trial used a\nstrategy that involved constructing static pressure-volume curves of the lung on the mechanical\nventilator. With this strategy, a lower inflection point can be calculated. This point identifies the\npressure at which the alveoli open. In ARDS, this point is typically 12\u201315 cmH2O. In theory,\nsetting the PEEP to this pressure will maximize oxygenation and prevent lung injury. Trials of\nthis mode of ventilation improve lung function and may have an effect on mortality.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mechanical ventilation can be delivered in many different modes, which refers to the manner in\nwhich the breaths are triggered, cycled, and delivered. The most common mode of mechanical\nventilation is assist-control. This mode is volume cycled and flow limited. An inspiratory cycle\nmay be triggered by patient effort or, if there is no patient effort within a specific time, by a\ntimer within the ventilator. Each breath, whether triggered by patient effort or the ventilator,\ndelivers an operator-specified tidal volume. This mode is frequently the initial mode of\nmechanical ventilation when a patient is intubated as it ensures a known minute ventilation in\nthe absence of respiratory effort. Common difficulties with the use of assist-control ventilation\nare asynchrony with the ventilator and tachypnea, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis and/or\ngeneration of dynamic hyperinflation. This occurs when a patient triggers an inspiratory cycle\nbefore a full exhalation occurs. Commonly known as auto-PEEP, dynamic hyperinflation can lead\nto decreased venous return and a fall in cardiac output. It may also lead to barotrauma,\nincluding pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) is\na mixed mode of ventilation. IMV is primarily a volume-cycled and flow-limited mode of\nventilation and is most often delivered in a synchronized mode (SIMV). The ventilator will\ndeliver a mandatory number of breaths at a specified tidal volume. If a patient breathes only at\nthe set respiratory rate, SIMV is essentially the same as assist-control ventilation. When a patient\nbreathes above the set respiratory rate, the spontaneous breaths may be unassisted or assisted\nwith a pressure support mode of ventilation. SIMV was commonly used as a weaning mode of\nventilation, but clinical trials have shown that trials of spontaneous breathing lead to a shorter\nduration of mechanical ventilation and more rapid extubation. Pressure control ventilation (PCV)\nis time triggered, time cycled, and pressure limited. This mode is often used in individuals who\nhave preexisting barotrauma or for postoperative thoracic surgery patients. It is also used in\nARDS to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. In PCV, there is no prespecified minimum tidal\nARDS to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. In PCV, there is no prespecified minimum tidal\nvolume or minute ventilation. Rather, a specified pressure is set during inspiration by the\noperator, and the tidal volume and inspiratory flow rate are dependent upon lung compliance.\nPressure support ventilation (PSV) is patient triggered, flow cycled, and pressure limited. PSV\nrequires a patient to spontaneously initiate respiration because no machine-delivered breaths are\ngiven. PSV provides graded assistance through application of an inspiratory pressure that\naugments spontaneous respiration. The pressure support falls to a specified expiratory pressure\nwhen the flow falls below a certain rate. PSV is often combined with SIMV to augment the\nspontaneously generated breaths. PSV also is used in ventilator weaning as it is generally well\ntolerated."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Shock is a complex pathophysiologic process that occurs in\nresponse to a decline in tissue perfusion. Clinically, shock states manifest with a mean arterial\npressure <60 mmHg. This nonspecific term can be caused by many different etiologies including\nsepsis, hypovolemia, trauma, hypoadrenal states, neurologic causes, and cardiac causes. Shock\nstates result in a decrease in tissue oxygen delivery. In turn, this creates a multifaceted response\nthat can become a self-perpetuating process that leads to further tissue injury. Hypotension\ndisinhibits the vasomotor center, leading to increased adrenergic output and decreased vagal\ntone. Norepinephrine leads to significant splanchnic and peripheral vasoconstriction in an\nattempt to maintain cerebral and cardiac blood flow. Other constrictor substances are secreted as\nwell including angiotensin II, vasopressin, endothelin-1, and thromboxane A2. In addition, there\nis pressure to maintain intravascular fluid volume through alterations in hydrostatic pressure and\nosmolarity. However, constriction of arterioles leads to reduction in capillary hydrostatic\npressure and the number of capillary beds perfused. This limits the capillary surface area\navailable for perfusion with the resultant increase in vascular oncotic pressure. This in turn leads\nto a net reabsorption of fluid into the vascular bed. Metabolic changes including glycolysis,\nlipolysis, and proteolysis further increase interstitial and intravascular volume at the expense of\nintracellular volume due to their effects on raising extracellular osmolarity. Within the cells,\nthere is rapid depletion of high-energy phosphate stores. This leads to mitochondrial dysfunction\nwith uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation with accumulation of reactive oxygen species,\nlactate, and hydrogen ions. The byproducts of anaerobic metabolism can overcome the\ncompensatory vasoconstrictor mechanisms and lead to further hypotension. Extensive\nproinflammatory pathways are activated in shock and contribute to the development of multiple\norgan dysfunction and failure. After the initial insult, a counterregulatory process should be\ninitiated to balance the proinflammatory response. In individuals who have an excessive\nproinflammatory response that cannot be effectively regulated, the inflammatory process may\ncontinue unregulated and lead to further organ injury and failure. At the system level, shock\naffects a variety of endocrine, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal processes, among others. In\naddition to increases in norepinephrine, the stress associated with shock increases\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to increase cortisol secretion. Renin is also released in\nresponse to adrenergic discharge and decreased renal perfusion. Renin induces the formation of\nangiotensin I, which is converted to the active angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor.\nAngiotensin II also stimulates release of aldosterone and vasopressin. The cardiac response to\nshock is to initially compensate by increasing heart rate. Many causes of shock, however, are\nshock is to initially compensate by increasing heart rate. Many causes of shock, however, are\nassociated with depression of myocardial contractility such that stroke volume is decreased for\nany given filling pressure.

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Different causes of shock are associated with different physiologic\nfindings throughout the vascular system. Although rarely used in most cases of shock, a\npulmonary artery catheter can be used to measure these values. However, it is important to\nunderstand pathologically what occurs in the vascular system. The typical measured variables\ninclude cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), mixed venous oxygen saturation\n(SVO2), central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).\nPatients who have interruption of sympathetic vasomotor input after high cervical cord injury or\nmajor head injury may experience neurogenic shock. In neurogenic shock, there is arteriolar\ndilation and venodilation. The result is a fall in all variables measured (CO, SVR, SVO2, CVP, and\nPCWP) (option E). Hypovolemia is the most common cause of shock and occurs due to acute\nblood loss or significant loss of plasma volume due to extravascular fluid sequestration.\nGastrointestinal or renal fluid losses may also lead to hypovolemic shock. In hypovolemic shock,\nCO is low; SVR is elevated; and SVO2, CVP, and PCWP are low (option A). Cardiogenic shock\n(option B) has similarly low CO, elevated SVR, and low SVO2. However, CVP and PCWP are\nelevated. Septic shock can be hyperdynamic or hypodynamic. Early in the septic shock, the\nhyperdynamic state predominates and is associated with increased CO, low SVR, and low SVO2.\nCVP and PCWP are variable and may be low, normal, or elevated (option C). The hypodynamic\nstate of septic shock is associated with low CO and high SVR with variable effect of CVP, PCWP,\nand SVO2. Shock following trauma is most often due to hypovolemia. However, after\nintravascular volume is restored, some individuals will continue to experience hypotension due\nto loss of plasma volume into the interstitium and injured tissues. This type of shock will be\nassociated with variable effects on CO and SVR with low SVO2, CVP, and PCWP. Finally,\nhypoadrenalism is a rare cause of shock associated with unrecognized adrenal insufficiency.\nHypoadrenal shock presents with a low CO, low SVO2, low CVP, low PCWP, and normal to low\nSVR."

(Chap. 325 and JAMA 2016;315:801\u2013810) Sepsis represents a dysregulated\nhost response to infection, and severity can range broadly from a mild inflammatory response to\nrefractory septic shock (Table VI-78). Multiple professional medical societies have attempted to\ncreate a standardized definition of sepsis and septic shock over the years to aid in early\nidentification of sepsis with the goal of improving patient outcomes. The most recent definition\nof sepsis simplifies diagnosis into two categories: sepsis and septic shock. This eliminates prior\ncategories included in the continuum of sepsis including systemic inflammatory response\ncategories included in the continuum of sepsis including systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis. SIRS criteria may be present in many individuals with\ninfection who do not develop progressive symptoms of sepsis. The symptoms that may indicate a\nharmful systemic response to infection are many of those previously included in the SIRS\ndefinition, including fever or hypothermia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. However,\nSIRS can be present due to systemic inflammatory responses with other stresses such as trauma\nor acute pancreatitis that are not caused by infection. Thus, the term SIRS is neither sensitive nor\nspecific for identifying patients at risk of developing sepsis. Severe sepsis was also a term with\nlimited specificity and did not provide additional risk stratification. In the simplified definition,\nthere is greater reliance on use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Sepsis\nis thus defined as a suspected or documented infection with an acute increase of \u22652 points,\nwhereas septic shock is clinically defined as sepsis with need for vasopressor support and\nelevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) despite adequate fluid resuscitation. The SOFA score incorporates\na variety of measures to determine the magnitude of multiorgan dysfunction. Variables include\nPaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count, bilirubin, Glasgow Coma Scale score, creatinine, urine output,\nand blood pressure/vasopressor support. Sepsis is identified as evidence of infection with\nevidence of organ dysfunction. Using the SOFA score as a determinant of organ dysfunction\ncreates a more standard measure for identifying sepsis. A patient may be considered in refractory\nseptic shock if the mean arterial pressure remains low for >1 hour despite fluid resuscitation\nand vasopressors.

Numerous interventions\nhave been attempted to try to decrease mortality by providing better supportive care or targeting\nthe underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to organ failure in sepsis. An example of a\nsupportive measure that has been proven ineffective in sepsis is insulin therapy to achieve tight\nglucose control. The rationale for lower blood glucose in sepsis was that hyperglycemia was\nassociated with poorer outcomes in critical illness. After initial enthusiasm from data generated\nby a single-center trial in a surgical ICU, the benefits were not demonstrated in a medically ill\npopulation. Meta-analyses have concluded that intensive insulin therapy does not affect survival\nand may lead to harm, particularly from hypoglycemia. Anemia also frequently develops in\nindividuals with critical illness. The target hemoglobin necessary to maintain oxygen-carrying\ncapacity has to be balanced against potential harm from transfusion therapy, including infection\nand transfusion-associated acute lung injury. A randomized trial demonstrated that patients were\nnot harmed by a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion (7 g/dL) compared to a higher\nhemoglobin goal (9 g/dL). Patients with refractory hypotension in sepsis have been shown to\nhave a relative deficiency of cortisol in the face of profound metabolic stress. This so-called\ncritical illness\u2013related corticosteroid insufficiency may lead to worse outcomes in critical illness.\nTrials to determine which patients would most benefit from corticosteroid replacement used\nadrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation to assess adrenal response to stimulus. However, this\napproach did not lead to improved outcomes, and most practitioners favor a more empiric\napproach to corticosteroid replacement. Hydrocortisone should be considered at a dose of 50 mg\nevery 6 hours in patients with septic shock on vasopressors. If clinical improvement occurs with\nuse of hydrocortisone over 24\u201348 hours, then a course of therapy for 5\u20137 days is indicated.

        "explanation": "Coma is a surprisingly common medical condition that is\nresponsible for a large number of admissions to emergency and critical care units. Coma refers to\na deep sleeplike state from which a patient cannot be aroused. It occurs on a continuum of\ndisorders of decreased alertness that includes stupor, in which a patient can be transiently\naroused with vigorous stimulation and with generally purposeful response to painful stimuli.\nDrowsiness is a light state of decreased alertness that is similar to light sleep. A patient can be\naroused easily, and alertness typically persists for a period after arousal. There are multiple\netiologies of coma and several disorders that can cause unresponsiveness that can be confused\nwith coma. Some of the common causes of coma include drug intoxications, metabolic\nderangements, severe systemic infections, shock, seizures, hypertensive encephalopathy,\nconcussion, meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and intracranial mass lesions,\namong others. One condition that is often confused with coma is the persistent vegetative state.\nA vegetative state refers to someone who has emerged from coma with an awake appearance but\nis unresponsive. There are few, if any, meaningful responses to stimuli from the environment.\nPersistent vegetative state occurs following significant damage to both cerebral hemispheres with\npreservation of brainstem function. It occurs most commonly following cardiac arrest or\ntraumatic brain injury. A minimally conscious state is similar to the persistent vegetative state\nbut less severe. The patient appears awake, can make rudimentary vocalizations, and may have\nsome purposeful motor behaviors, occasionally in response to commands. Other syndromes that\ncan mimic coma include akinetic mutism, catatonia, and locked-in state. Akinetic mutism occurs\ndue to extreme hydrocephalus or damage to the medial thalamic nuclei or frontal lobes. In\nakinetic mutism, the patient appears awake and is able to think and form memories but is unable\nto move or speak. Upon recovery, the patient can recount events from the period of the mutism.\nCatatonia usually occurs in individuals with severe psychiatric illness. Patients make few\nvoluntary or responsive movements, although they do not appear distressed. On careful\nexamination, it usually becomes apparent the patient is responsive. Eyes will move with head\nrotation, and the patient will blink with a visual threat. Other subtle signs may be present as\nwell. Locked-in syndrome occurs following an injury to the ventral pons. In this setting, the\npatient has normal cerebral function but has no means to produce speech or movement. The only\nmovements a patient will have are voluntary vertical movement of the eyes and lid elevation."

        "explanation": "Brain death refers to the irreversible loss of all cerebral and\nbrainstem function. Cardiac activity is preserved, and respiration is maintained only by artificial\nmeans. In Western society, brain death is considered equivalent to death, and the respirator can\nbe disconnected to allow cardiac death to occur. Careful examination of a patient needs to be\nperformed to assess when brain death has occurred. At the time of examination, the patient\nneeds to be normothermic and have been without treatment with sedative medications for at\nleast 6\u201324 hours. Patients should also be maintaining a systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg and\nbe euvolemic. Ideal criteria are simple, can be assessed at the bedside, and should have no\nchance of diagnostic error. Three essential elements of brain death include:\n1. Widespread cortical destruction identified by coma and unresponsiveness to all stimuli.\n2.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important tool in the\ncare of selected critically ill patients due to neurologic injury or disease. ICP can be monitored\nby ventriculostomy, intraparenchymal transducer, epidural catheter, or subarachnoid catheters.\nEpidural or subarachnoid catheters are less reliable and are less frequently used.\nVentriculostomy is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for ICP monitoring because it offers the\nadvantage of providing a means of cerebrospinal fluid drainage in the event of elevated ICP. In\naddition, ventriculostomy monitoring also provides greater accuracy because it has the ability to\nbe recalibrated, whereas the intraparenchymal monitor does not. Patients who are most likely to\nbe considered for ICP monitoring are those with severe primary neurologic disorders, including\nsevere traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale \u22648), large tissue shifts from supratentorial\nischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, intraventricular hemorrhage, or posterior fossa stroke.\nIndividuals with fulminant hepatic failure are also at risk for severe cerebral edema leading to\nherniation. ICP monitoring is recommended for these individuals, although intraparenchymal\nmonitoring is often more appropriate than ventriculostomy due to the presence of coagulopathy.\nThese patients are at particularly high risk of bleeding. In addition, individuals with diffuse\ncerebral edema, such as in fulminant hepatic failure, typically have small ventricles leading to\ndifficulty in placement."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The primary goal of ICP monitoring in patients with severe\nneurologic injury and elevated ICP is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).\nCPP is calculated as mean arterial pressure minus the ICP, and the goal CPP is \u226560 mmHg.\nNormal ICP is <20 mmHg. Thus, this patient is showing evidence of marked elevations in ICP\nwith a CPP of 58 mmHg. When ICP remains elevated for more than 5 minutes, therapy should be\nundertaken to decrease the ICP. It is important to consider the underlying cause of ICP in an\nindividual when determining treatment plan. In patients with hydrocephalus or subarachnoid\nhemorrhage, draining cerebrospinal fluid via the ventriculostomy will decrease the ICP. In\npatients with more diffuse cerebral edema from head trauma or stroke, medical approaches are\nmore appropriate. This patient has hydrocephalus due to subarachnoid bleeding. Therefore, the\nfirst line of treatment should be to drain the ventriculostomy. If this fails to adequately alleviate\nthe elevations in ICP, other treatment modalities including osmolar therapy, sedation,\nhyperventilation, or vasopressors to increase mean arterial pressure can be considered. There are\ntwo osmolar therapies that are frequently used: mannitol or 23.4% saline bolus. Deep sedation\nmay be required, and a variety of agents may be used. Neuromuscular blockade may be used as\nwell. Hyperventilation to drop the PaCO2 to 30\u201335 mmHg works acutely to drop the ICP, but the\neffect is limited. Vasopressors can be considered to increase the mean arterial pressure and thus\nensure an improved CPP. Glucocorticoids are best used in individuals with vasogenic edema\nfrom tumor or abscess. In those with refractory elevations in ICP, decompressive craniectomy,\nhigh-dose barbiturate therapy, or hypothermia may also be employed."

In rare instances, it can be seen in chronic\nlymphoma or solid tumors. As the chemotherapeutic agents act on these cells, there is massive\ntumor lysis that results in release of intracellular ions and nucleic acids. This leads to a\ncharacteristic metabolic syndrome of hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and\nhypocalcemia. Acute kidney injury is frequent and can lead to renal failure requiring\nhemodialysis if uric acid crystallizes within the renal tubules. Lactic acidosis and dehydration\nincrease the risk of acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia occurs due to the release of\nintracellular phosphate ions and causes a reciprocal reduction in serum calcium. This\nhypocalcemia can be profound, leading to neuromuscular irritability and tetany. Hyperkalemia\ncan become rapidly life-threatening and cause ventricular arrhythmia. Knowing the\ncharacteristics of tumor lysis syndrome, one can attempt to prevent the known complications\nfrom occurring. It is important to monitor serum electrolytes frequently during treatment.\nLaboratory studies should be obtained no less than three times daily, but more frequent\nmonitoring is often needed.
